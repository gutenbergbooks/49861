<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>This</span> was no comedy to those most concerned, of
course, for comedy is like happiness—directly a
person knows he is in it, he is out of it. Tragedy,
on the other hand, can only touch those who do
not take themselves seriously enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No man, however, could take himself more
seriously than did the Reverend Andrew Deane as
he travelled down alone in a third-class railway
carriage to his new living of Gaythorpe-on-the-Marsh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the train neared Millsby, the station for
Gaythorpe, he rose hastily and peered at the
piece of looking-glass provided for self-conscious
travellers. Yes, his worst fears were altogether
justified. His hair curled in a stiff bush above
his forehead, in spite of brilliantine applied at the
very last moment before leaving his London lodgings.
Why—he demanded desperately of himself—why
had he not brought a bottle in his
pocket?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For he considered curls not only undignified
but unclerical. His sensitiveness on the subject
had started at the age of six, when he still wore
them rather long and other little boys called him
“Annie”! He fought the other little boys and
induced his mother to have his hair cut, but the
wound remained and rankled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! Most annoying!” he said, passing
his hand over his offending head. Then he sat
down and blew his nose nervously as the train
glided into Millsby station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morning, Mr. Deane. I suppose you are the
Reverend Deane?” said a fat gentleman with
black hair and a red face, approaching the carriage
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Thank you. How-do-you-do?” said
Andy, rather jerkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name’s Thorpe,” said the fat man, with
colossal repose. “I’m the churchwarden. Glad
to welcome you to your new parish, though it’s
only for a few hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very kind,” responded Andy, feeling
sure that the porter, the stationmaster and three
stragglers were listening, and anxious to be as
like his late senior curate—who was tall, lean,
and immensely impressive—as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect you’re going to see what you want in
the way of furniture for the Vicarage?” said
Mr. Thorpe, moving ponderously towards the
gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Andy breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is rather a breathless thing, of course, to
stand finally on the summit of one’s desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cart’s waiting. No luggage this time, I
s’pose?” said Mr. Thorpe, who economised
words. “Come this way, then.” And to the
stationmaster, who stepped forward, thin and
alert: “This is the Reverend Deane, our new
Vicar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the parson shook hands, but that was
nothing; because an eternal handshaking is as
essential a part of a clergyman’s life as putting
on his trousers: it was the absence of the Andrew
that went home to him. All his life he had been
dogged by an undignified “Andy,” which was
even more unclerical than the curls. Now he
meant to drop it for ever. No one here had
known him before at school or college—no one
here was acquainted with the aunt by marriage
and the cousins who had been his family since
the age of sixteen—he would drop the boyish
“Andy” into the limbo of the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From all this it will be gathered, and rightly,
that the Reverend Andrew Deane had obtained a
living almost as soon as it was legally possible,
and that he had a boyish air which made every
one treat him like a boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a good strawberry bed in the Vicarage
garden,” said Mr. Thorpe, as he settled himself
in the cart. “Gee-up, mare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he seemed to think he had said all there
was to say, and they jogged on silently through
the quiet lanes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the hurry and bustle of the growing years,
and the time at college, and the London curacy,
Andy seemed, as he sat there, to have come out
into some quiet place where he could look round
and listen. He felt, unconsciously, as a man
does who has stood on a country road to watch
a noisy procession pass: the last straggler vanishes
in the cloud of dust behind it—the clash of music
and shouting dies away—and a lark that has
sung unnoticed all the time, goes on singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the voice of peace grown audible at
last, and those are very happy who hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H-hem,” said Mr. Thorpe, rousing himself
at a sharp corner. “Funny you should be a
bachelor. We seem in for unmarried parsons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the present day there are many——” began
Andy. But when Mr. Thorpe started a
speech he had a sort of steam-roller habit of finishing
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was looking at the church-books the other
day—they only go back to 1687—and the first
vicar whose name stands there was a bachelor.
He was there fifty years. He signed himself
Will Ford, though he’s called Gulielmus now on
his grave by the churchyard path. Gee-up,
mare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in that minute Andy saw it all, and across
the centuries he greeted a brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the church,” said Mr. Thorpe, pulling
up on the crest of a little hill and pointing with
his whip towards a square tower with the roofs
of a village clustering near; a flight of rooks
trailed across blue sky and grey-white clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s—it’s extraordinarily peaceful,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so peaceful as you’d——However,
best find out for yourself,” said Mr. Thorpe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they jogged on again, cop, cop, cop in a
sunny silence, until they neared the Vicarage,
when the churchwarden added—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. and Mrs. Stamford are away, else
they’d have asked you to lunch, of course, as
they gave you the living. I thought you’d maybe
look round the Vicarage, and then come up to
my house for a meal. Mrs. Thorpe has a
cold fowl waiting for you when you’re ready for
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. It’s awfully good——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’d have stopped to show you round
myself,” said Mr. Thorpe, rolling on, as it were,
over Andy’s acknowledgments, “but I have to
see a man about some pigs. However, young
Sam Petch’ll be there. He was odd man to the
old Vicar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you advise me to retain his services?”
inquired Andy, with the responsible dignity of a
vicar and a householder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um,” said Mr. Thorpe. “I don’t know.
The poor old Vicar grew very feeble towards the
end, and let things go. And those Petches are
none of ’em models. They don’t seem to know
when they’re speaking the truth and when they
aren’t. And young Sam drinks a bit too. No,
I can’t really advise you to keep him on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall certainly not do so after what you tell
me,” said the new Vicar, sitting very erect. “I
have the strongest feelings about the households
of the clergy—they should be above reproach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y-yes,” said Mr. Thorpe. Then, relieved,
“And, of course, the Petches have William to fall
back on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there is any one responsible that settles——”
began Andy, when the mare shied violently
at a man on the road, and he had to devote his attention
to his new hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the man who’s waiting to see me about
the pigs,” said Mr. Thorpe calmly, indicating a
red-faced, angry-looking person on the roadside.
“He looks as if he was tired of waiting. Should
you mind walking across the churchyard instead
of driving round to the Vicarage gate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” cried Andy, jumping down; and
followed by Mr. Thorpe’s hearty “Mind you
come up for a meal as soon as you’re ready,” he
went through the churchyard gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It clicked loosely behind him, easy with the
passing of the generations, and as he walked down
the path a great many of these thoughts which
are common to all generous youth passed through
his mind; for there is, in every one of us, such a
glorious wish to do something for the world when
we are young, though we can no more talk about
it, then, than Andy could have done as he looked
at the gravestone of that Gulielmus who in life
had been plain Will Ford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even to his own soul, Andy did not say those
things; he only remarked to himself that he would
be always, as it were, Gulielmus. The abbreviation
should not intrude. The Reverend Andrew
Deane he was, and the Reverend Andrew Deane
he would remain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus reflecting he reached the little gate leading
into the Vicarage garden, and a tall, middle-aged
man stood there, cap in hand. Honesty was
in his blue eyes—respectful candour in his pleasant
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Thorpe wished me to show you round,
sir,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Good-day. Where is the lad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lad?” said the man, a little surprised.
“Oh, he’s got a place at Millsby, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. That’s excellent,” said Andy, much
relieved at not being obliged to start with a dismissal.
“Now for the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peas here,” said the man, passing a plot of
ground, “and beans there. I bought the seed
and sowed them on my own responsibility. ‘Whoever’s
coming,’ says I to myself, ‘old or young,
he’ll want peas and beans.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words flowed in that delightful easy way
which is of all human sounds the most comfortable,
running into the heart like a cordial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most thoughtful of you,” said Andy warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his fellow-curates in London had talked
of the apathy of village people! He would tell
them about this when he saw them. What working-man
of their flock would buy peas and beans
and sow them for love of the Church?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I put a row of potatoes in too,” continued
the man. “Says I to my wife, ‘Married <span class='it'>or</span> single,
he’ll want potatoes.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re married, then?” said Andy, as they
reached the house door, wishful to show interest
in the domestic concerns of this ardent churchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied the man. “My wife can’t get
about much, I’m sorry to say. Legs given way.
But”—he gave a queer side look at Andy—“it
isn’t that she’s lost power, so to speak: the power’s
only moved from her legs into her tongue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy smiled back—and when two men enjoy
together the immemorial joke about a woman’s
tongue it is as good as a sign of freemasonry—then
he said solemnly, “Very sad for you both,
I am sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the man, immediately solemn too.
“I’m sure I don’t know what we would do if it
wasn’t for William.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William!” repeated Andy. “Why—what
is your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Samuel Petch,” said the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it will be <span class='it'>young</span> Sam Petch who has
taken a situation at Millsby?” demanded Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I’m</span> young Sam Petch. Father’s old Sam
Petch. He’s eighty-one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And almost in silence he went over the Vicarage
escorted by his pleasant and obliging guide, who
said at every turn, “We ought to trim honeysuckle;
I only waited until you came,” or “I
put a few newspapers down here, because the sun
seemed to be fading the paint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy tramped up and down stairs, and peered
into cellars, and found no words in which to inform
young Sam Petch that his services were not
required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How was it possible in face of that trustful
confidence to say abruptly, “You are mistaken.
You may remove your peas, beans, and potatoes,
or I will pay for them. Even your wife’s legs are
nothing to me, though I deplore them. You must
depart”? Andy could not do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Sam Petch went back to lock up the
opened rooms while the new Vicar stood alone at
his own front door. It was rather a dignified
door, with pillars where roses grew and five steps
leading into the garden, and Andy’s heart swelled
with a proud sense of possession. Here he would
stand welcoming in the senior curate who had
treated him like a rather stupid schoolboy. Here
the aunt and cousins who could not remember that
he was a man and a clergyman would take on a
proper attitude of respect. Here the lady lay-helper
who had so condescended to him in the
London parish would be received, kindly, but—He
held out a hand and rehearsed the greeting.
The bland and prosperous Vicar on his own
threshold. Quite equal to dealing with anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A-hem!” coughed Sam Petch behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—that you, Sam?” said Andy, turning
very red and drawing in his hand. “We—er—we
had better be moving on. I was just—er—exercising
my arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exercise splendid thing, sir,” said Sam, tactfully
looking away. And while they walked down
the road Andy said to himself that a man accustomed
for two years to dealing with sharp Cockneys
would find the simple villager a very easy
problem. All he had to do was to wait until they
reached the cottage at the next turning and then
say, firmly but kindly, that he did not need Mr.
Petch’s services.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The turning was two hundred yards away—one
hundred and fifty——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s my poor wife at the gate,” said Sam.
“Looked after the old Vicar like a mother, she
did, until her legs went. It’s one of her bad days,
but she was bent on saying a word of welcome to
you as you went past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of course Andy had to put it off a little
longer while he took Mrs. Petch’s hand and bade
her “Good morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She placed her other hand on her heart, and
began to speak quickly in a thin, high voice with
a gasp in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m done up, sir—waiting here so long for
you—will you step in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, of course, Andy went through the little
garden in the wake of Mrs. Petch’s dragging footsteps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s such a comfort,” said Mrs. Petch, sitting
limply, “to feel we’re settled again. Unsettledness
is what tries the female nerves worse than
anything, as you’ll no doubt find out some day,
sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy passed his hand across his brow. It was
very difficult. But it was now or never. He
rushed blindly at the fence with an incoherent—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to disappoint you, Mrs. Petch, but
I have—that is to say—your husband’s services
will not be required.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mopped his brow, forgetful of all clerical
dignity, while Mr. and Mrs. Petch looked at him
and said nothing, and he felt as if red-hot worms
were crawling about his unprotected person. Still
they said nothing; and that was what made it so
awful. At last a parrot screeched in the stillness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you have a relative to—er—fall
back upon,” said poor Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Petch took a drink of water and passed
a handkerchief across her eyes, then she asked
faintly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What relative?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One named—er—William,” said Andy.
“I understand——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“T-that’s William!” interrupted Mrs. Petch,
pointing to the parrot; then she laughed hysterically
and burst into tears. “We get five shillings
a week from an old mistress of mine as long as
the parrot lives. And for that my poor husband
is to lose his place. Oh, it’s hard—it’s cruel hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stood up, rather upset, but determined
now to go through with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he said. “That’s not the only
reason. I gather that your husband is addicted to
drink.” Andy paused and elevated his chin. “A
clergyman’s household must be above reproach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not true,” said Mrs. Petch eagerly.
“He’s always so much livelier than the other men
at Gaythorpe that when he gets a glass and is a
bit livelier still, they think he’s drunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me a chance, sir,” said Sam Petch, in a
low tone, speaking at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of all the winged words in any language
which he could have chosen to shoot straight at
Andy’s heart, those were most sure to hit the core
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chance!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, Andy’s young soul had been wrung during
those two years in London by the sight of thousands
who had never had a chance, or who had
missed it, or had wilfully wasted it. The ragged
horde of them with haggard eyes and dirty soft
hands seemed to press about him in the flowery
silence of the cottage doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he said, drawing a long breath.
“I’ll give you a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shan’t have cause to regret it, sir,” said
Sam Petch quietly, with a simple manliness that
pleased Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the same, on leaving the cottage, he felt
bound to pause at the door in order to deliver a
further warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must ask you to adhere to the strict truth in
all our dealings together,” he remarked austerely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He always does,” said Mrs. Petch, before her
husband could reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be glad to find it so,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only,” added Sam Petch, scratching his head,
“it’s so hard to tell the difference. A lie—well,
often it isn’t exactly a lie——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else can it be?” demanded Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lie——” repeated Sam. “Well, it’s
often”—he searched the ceiling and derived inspiration
from a string of onions—“it’s often
the truth the other way out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The difference between truth and falsehood
is always perfectly clear and distinct,” said Andy,
opening the door. And, really, he was still young
enough to think so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam Petch accompanied him with a sort of subdued
dignity to the Thorpes’, and there said farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may rely on me, sir,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy held out his hand impulsively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I may, Petch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the churchwarden’s wife came hospitably
forward and shook hands with the new Vicar.
She was as fat as Mr. Thorpe, but with a different
sort of fatness; for while he seemed to be made
of something very solid, like wood, she shook and
wobbled to such an extent that Andy, following
her down two steps into a cool room, held his
breath involuntarily for fear she should crack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Thorpe’s out still,” she said, panting
slightly. “But my nephew will take you to wash
your hands. Wa-alter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fat youth with round cheeks that swelled up
under his eyes came reluctantly through the
French window, followed by a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re holidaying,” said Mrs. Thorpe.
“Now you go and have a wash, and then come
down and help yourself. I shall be somewhere
about when you’ve finished your meal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat boy escorted the guest upstairs, and
left him in the spotless stuffiness of the spare-bedroom,
where everything smelt of camphor and
lavender. When Andy came down he was almost
dismayed to see the banquet which had been prepared
for him. Cold fowls. A whole ham. A
huge trifle. A dish of tarts and cheesecakes. A
cream cheese. It was stupendous. And Mrs.
Thorpe’s fowls and cheeses and hams were all
bigger, tarts more full of jam, cheesecakes more
overflowing with yellow richness, than any in the
whole shire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Thorpe had never been an uncharitable
woman, and in speaking of a mean relative the
most scornful thing she could say was, “You
could eat one of her cheesecakes in a mouthful.
Now you know the sort of woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy sat down, realising that he was very hungry,
and he was rather consoled to find that some
one had obviously been lunching before him. He
would scarcely have dared to mar the exquisite
proportions of the trifle or to disturb the elegant
decoration of the fowls. The previous luncher
had even spilt fragments on the shining tablecloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at his watch, and began to eat
hastily, finding his time was growing short, and
as he was finishing Mrs. Thorpe came in. She
paused at the door, gave a little grunt of astonishment
which she changed into a cough, and said
heartily—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I am glad you’ve enjoyed your lunch.
Mary”—she shouted down a long stone passage—“bring
in the coffee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary—and this was a queer thing—Mary
also paused in the doorway with a grunt of astonishment
which she turned into a cough; but
Andy did not notice this, and after drinking his
coffee he climbed into Mr. Thorpe’s cart, and was
driven to the station, feeling as only a man can
feel who gets what he wants from life before he
loses his illusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The groom eyed him curiously as he sat looking
straight ahead with the light of youth and
hopeful candour shining in his eyes—but the
groom’s gaze was upon his slack waistcoat, not
upon his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>And in a corner of the Thorpes’ orchard fat
Walter and his friend were still munching the last
remnants of a stolen feast.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The cart arrived so early at the railway station
that Andy had nearly half an hour to wait, and
as one country person after another came upon
the platform, and joined a group, an obvious whisper
went round, followed by a furtive inspection
of the black-coated stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy straightened his shoulders, and unconsciously
endeavoured to assume an expression of
benevolent dignity. Naturally, they were interested
in the new Vicar of Gaythorpe. It would
have surprised Andy very much at the moment to
have met any one who was not interested in that
gentleman, and he felt a little glow, in passing one
of the groups, to hear a woman say—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s so slight and thin. You’d wonder
where he <span class='it'>could</span> put it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H-hush!” warned the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy smiled inwardly and settled his collar.
Of course they referred to his brain. Well, it
was rather a wonderful thing to have a living presented
to one at twenty-five by a man who had
only chanced to hear a single sermon. He thought
it all over again. The old friend of his Vicar
attending morning service—the interview three
days later—the astonishing offer of a living that
was a rich one, as livings go in these days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Andy to himself, stepping
into the railway carriage, “I <span class='it'>was</span> rather trenchant
that morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced out of the window as the train
slipped away through the spring afternoon, and
congratulated himself on the impression he seemed
to have made on his new neighbours. They would
be eager to see him again. Ridiculous for the
London clergy to talk of apathy in the face of
such interest as he had seen at Millsby station.
The parishioners were already discussing the
mental qualifications of the new Vicar with a
keenness that was perfectly delightful.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>And in the next compartment three women bent
together, discussing a wonder.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Was it six cheesecakes that Thorpe’s groom
said?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>And eight tarts! And you know Mrs.
Thorpe’s tarts.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Besides ham and fowl and half one of her
great trifles.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>He must have got some complaint.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oh, I hear them London curates is half
starved. P’raps he’d never seen a meal like that
before, and he couldn’t stop.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>But you’d think he’d burst!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>That’s just it. That’s just where the wonder
comes in. Cool and thin as a lath after it all.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I shall go to hear him preach.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>So shall I. Good as the Sword-Eating Man
at Bardswell Fair. Ha-ha!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Andy!</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> Andy passed through his own hall between his
own umbrella-stand and eight-day clock on his
way to pay a parochial call, he stepped lightly, less
like the proud incumbent of an excellent country
living than a schoolboy who endeavours to escape
a maiden aunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was no use. Before he reached the
porch a door was opened, and Mrs. Jebb, the
housekeeper, fluttered forth from the back regions.
She had previously fluttered in and out
of matrimony in rather the same way, and seemed
to have brought nothing from it but a wedding
ring and a black satin dress trimmed with beads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had, however, brought something hidden
as well—a profound conviction that she was fascinating
to the gentlemen. Her late husband had
been wont to remark, during their brief married
life, that there was a something in her way of looking
out of her eye-corners that was enough to
upset an aconite. He meant a rather different
thing, but he was not as cultured as Mrs. Jebb
would have liked him to be. Still the habit of—as
she inwardly phrased it—“eye-cornering”
clung to her still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s aunt chose her solely because she and
sex seemed to have no connection—which is only
another proof that nobody knows anything at all
about anybody else—and she called herself a
lady-cook-housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She “eye-cornered” Andy now as she came
flitting after him to the front door, but more for
the sake of practice than from any ulterior motive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Might</span> I ask you—you <span class='it'>do</span> pass the grocer’s
shop—and we are out of soft sugar?” She had
a way of talking in gasps until she got fairly
started, when nothing would stop her. “I am so
sorry to make mistakes, but I must ask you
to try and remember that I never expected to
serve even in the—er—higher reaches of domestic—when
Mr. Jebb——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me,” said Andy, seizing his hat from
the peg, “I am rather pressed for——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>And</span> a pound of rice, if you <span class='it'>would</span> be so very
kind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted. Of course,” said Andy incoherently,
escaping down the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had already learned that the reminiscences
of life with Mr. Jebb were so long and varied
that it seemed strange a year could have held
them all, and of so intimate and pathetic a nature
that, once fairly started, it were sheer brutality
to cut them short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But half-way down the drive a thin voice floated
out to him—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Candles—a pound of candles—if you
<span class='it'>could</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked back, and there she stood on the
doorstep, eye-cornering Andy from afar, with
strands of brownish hair and odd bits of cheap
white lace fluttering about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he shouted back; but to himself
he grunted, “Silly old kitten. What on earth
did Aunt Dixon get me an old fool like that for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a sudden waft of lilac scent warmed by
sunshine, which is the essence of spring, swept
across Andy’s freckled nose, and he felt kind to
all the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let her <span class='it'>be</span> a kitten! I don’t care. It’s
hardish lines on an old woman like that having to
go out into service——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old woman!</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a glorious thing it is that nobody can see
into the mind of anybody else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy turned into Parson’s Lane, where the
birds sang, and wild flowers bloomed earlier than
anywhere else, and lovers walked silent on summer
evenings; and he began to whistle from pure
happiness. Then he remembered his position
and hummed the “March of the Men of Harlech”
instead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow’s house stood at the farther end of
the village, and when Andy went in at the farm
gate he saw preparations going forward for that
little tragedy, a country sale. The room into
which he was ushered stood carpetless, miraculously
swept and garnished, its large table crowded
with glass and china that had remained for years
hidden in the great storeroom, excepting on rare
festivals, when it was brought out with care and
put away by the hands of the mistress. A big
sideboard filled one wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid,” said Andy, “that I’ve come at
the wrong time, Mrs. Simpson. I’ll call again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Simpson, who was a fair woman with a
meek brow and an obstinate mouth, motioned him
to a seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything’s ready,” she said. “We go into
the little cottage near you to-night. My husband’s
cousins, the Thorpes, wanted us to stop
with them for a few days, but I felt I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope—I hope you’ll be comfortable in
your new home,” said Andy, who was not glib at
consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Simpson crossed her hands on her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I shall be comfortable enough. My husband’s
family have behaved well. They have
clubbed together to make me and the children a
little allowance—and they’re buying in all the
furniture we need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy rose. He could not find anything to say
to a woman years older than himself, who had
lost her husband and her home—so, of course,
he was a poor sort of parson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a garden in your new home? May I
send you some flowers?” he asked, going towards
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you; but flowers make dirt in a little
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were near the big sideboard now, and
in his confusion Andy caught his elbow in the
corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is going to be sold, too,” said Mrs.
Simpson. “The Thorpes won’t buy that in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—yes,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, suddenly, Mrs. Simpson’s face began to
work like a child’s before it cries aloud, and she
passed her hand over the smooth surface of the
top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody’s ever polished it but myself. We
bought it in London on our honeymoon. Now
Mrs. Will Werrit’ll get it—and those girls of
hers’ll put hot-water jugs on the polished
top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stood there, touched to the heart, struggling
for something to say, and only able to stammer
out ridiculously at last—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they’ll use mats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he went home he began to wonder if he
could afford to buy the sideboard and present it to
Mrs. Simpson. No; he had had so many expenses
on entering the incumbency that there was
practically nothing at the bank. The little fortune
which had sufficed for his education and for
furnishing the Vicarage was now at an end. He
literally could not lay hands on a spare five-pound
note. A certain sum he had set aside for
the new bicycle which was a necessity in a country
living, but that was all he had over and above the
amount for current expenses——</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thoughts stopped in that unpleasant way
everybody knows, when a conclusion is forced
upon an unwilling mind. He turned into the
yard and pulled out his old bicycle. It would
do. It was not a dignified machine, but it would
do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had to see that as he trundled it dismally
back again and went into the house to search for a
bill of Mrs. Simpson’s sale among his papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Oh, nonsense! He wouldn’t!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down to tea and glanced at his dining-room
furniture, almost ecclesiastical in its chaste
simplicity, and heaved a sigh of annoyance. Then,
taking a large piece of cake in one hand and a
newspaper in the other, he endeavoured to immerse
himself in the news of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Did Mr. and Mrs. Simpson feel anything like
as jolly as he did when he bought his new furniture?
If so——</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to the foreign telegrams, and in the
midst of China and Peru he saw Mrs. and an
imaginary Mr. Simpson buying a sideboard for
their new home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pshaw! He flung down his paper and rang
for the little maid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please tell Mrs. Jebb I shall want lunch at
twelve to-morrow. I am going out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, feeling that it was a deed which accorded
more with a freckled nose and an abbreviated
Christian name than with the dignified attitude of
a Vicar of position, he began to search the sale
catalogue for a mahogany sideboard. He knew
that the senior curate would never have done such
a thing. He would have given the money to the
deserving poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy felt profoundly thankful that the senior
curate would never know as he wrote to countermand
his order for a new bicycle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that he went across the field and looked
over the hedge into the churchyard, where that
Mrs. Werrit who was his rival for the sideboard
chanced to be tending the graves of such Werrits
as were already taking their rest. People in Gaythorpe
said that it was the only time a true Werrit
did rest; and Mrs. Will was one to the backbone
though she had been born a Thorpe of
Millsby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was strange to Andy, who had always lived
in towns, to find that nearly all the people were
more or less related to one another: the Thorpes
and Werrits permeated the social relationships of
the countryside in the very same way as one or
two great families have done the aristocracy of
England. It is a thing that is going, but it survives
still in many country places, and it produces
a social atmosphere which is rather different from
any other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, good afternoon, Mr. Deane,” called
Mrs. Will Werrit, shrill and piping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stood idly watching the low sun slant
across the graves, and across the woman’s kneeling
figure. A cuckoo cried up into the clear, keen
air; a little way off a cock was crowing. Something
that Andy felt, and tried to grasp, and
couldn’t, was in that quiet afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came back over the fields with his hands
deep in his pockets, unconsciously trying to make
out what it was, and he felt inclined to write a
piece of poetry that afternoon because he was
young and alone and in love with life. It is an
instinct, under such circumstances, for people to
try to catch hold of the glory by putting it into
words, just as a child instinctively tries to get hold
of the sunshine, and both occupations are equally
silly and joyful and engrossing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy walked in through his study window
and sat at his table, looking out over the green
and golden day that shimmered up by most exquisite
gradations to a sky just before sunset.
Green of the close-cut lawn—green and gold of
the holly hedge—gold and green of the trees
full in the sun—gold of the lower sky—translucent
green of the cloudless upper reaches. No
wonder Andy’s growing soul groped and groped
after some way of keeping this. No wonder he
stretched out baby hands of the soul. And no
wonder that he grasped nothing. Or so near
nothing that this is all he found to say about the
Werrits near the church porch with Mrs. Will
Werrit bending over them. He called it “The
Others,” and was melancholy—as all happy
poets are—</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Andy read it over. He thought it was very
beautiful indeed, and began to compose an epitaph
for himself when he should lie, like Gulielmus, beneath
the shadow of the ancient church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great poet and a great priest. Fifty years
of untiring service——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, he was so young and so happy that he
enjoyed it very much indeed. And he was so
hungry afterwards that he was able to eat Mrs.
Jebb’s pastry.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The next day about two o’clock he went across
the lawn to speak to his gardener about the radishes
when it suddenly occurred to him that he
had seen nothing of that worthy since half-past
ten, though he had been about the place all the
morning. Evidently young Sam Petch was beginning
his games. This should be put a stop to
at once. Andy walked over the short grass with
a determined step, and was about to start the
inquisition when Sam, with a pleasant smile, remarked—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice morning I had of it. Searching high
and low, I was, for bits of cloth to nail up the
creepers on the stable wall. And in the end my
poor missus gave me the clippings she’d saved for
pegging a hearthrug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy looked hard at his gardener, but it was
his own eyes which fell before the radiant honesty
shining in Sam Petch’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good of Mrs. Petch—I must see if I
haven’t an old pair——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off, for he had come closer to Sam in
speaking, and there was somewhere in the air
an unmistakable odour of the public-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your oldest would be too good for that job,”
said Sam hastily. “My wife would sponge ’em
with beer with a drop o’ gin in it and they’d look
like new. She does that, time and again, to my
old clothes. These I have on she did last night.
On’y drawback is, you can’t get the smell of the
liquor out all at once. You’ll maybe not have
noticed, but I smell a smell of drink about this
here jacket yet, though I’ve been out in it since
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy looked hard again. Again he was
met by the clear, blue gaze of honesty and
simple candour. He walked away, making no
remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But half-way across the grass he paused, shook
his head, and went back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have you know,” he said, copying as
closely as possible the air and manner of the senior
curate, “that I am perfectly able to appreciate
the difference between the odour of beer applied
externally and internally. Pray remember
that for the future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, head in air, he marched towards the
house, feeling greatly annoyed that a dandelion
root should trip him up half-way and spoil the
exit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam watched him go into the house, and then
bent over the mowing machine in a paroxysm
of helpless laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golly—he’s a rum ’un—but not so soft as
he looks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For young Sam Petch had many failings, but
also the great virtue of being able to enjoy a joke
against himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Andy made his way to Mrs. Simpson’s
sale, and as he entered the house the auctioneer’s
raucous voice could be heard selling the
spare-bedroom furniture. Every one was upstairs
save a few who waited in the dining-room so as
to have a good place when the auctioneer came in
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Will Werrit, for instance,
had planted themselves firmly by the table
on which Mrs. Simpson’s cut glass and china were
displayed. They were not surprised to see the
new Vicar, as they supposed he would be wanting
things for his house, and Mrs. Thorpe tore herself
away from a fascinating and confidential conversation
with her neighbour to say pleasantly
glancing at him over her ample chest—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you’re comfortable at Gaythorpe, Mr.
Deane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was what Mrs. Thorpe wanted every one
to be in this world—comfortable—and it was
certainly what she hoped for in the world to
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m more than comfortable,” said Andy. “I
love the place already. And after London it
seems so peaceful—like one big family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Will Werrit’s thin lips curled at the corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are big families peaceful in London?” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well!” said Mrs. Thorpe, soothingly.
“Human nature is human nature. And how
does your housekeeper cook, Mr. Deane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not very grandly,” said Andy, with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can she make decent pastry?” asked Mrs.
Will Werrit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But I’m not much of a pastry lover—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Will Werrit.
Then they coughed behind their gloves to
tone down the ejaculation, and carefully avoided
each other’s glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy wondered what on earth there was
to be so surprised at in the fact that he did not
like pastry. He walked to the window and stood
there with his hands in his pockets while the two
women resumed their interrupted conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear?” said Mrs. Will Werrit.
“He said he didn’t like pastry. After eating six
tarts and eight cheesecakes at a sitting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well. I’m sure I don’t know how that
got about. I never told a soul, that I can
swear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody,” said Mrs. Will Werrit, snapping
her lips together, “can blame a lad for liking
tarts and cheesecakes. But what I hate is his lying
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come! You can’t call it lying,” said
Mrs. Thorpe. “Poor lad, he’s ashamed of his
appetite, I expect.” She touched a set of glass
dishes on the table before her. “I’m bidding for
those.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t touch ’em!” said Mrs. Will sharply.
“There’s a woman looking at you. You don’t
want anybody to notice them before they’re auctioned
if you can help it. They’ll be running you
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t go beyond two shillings apiece,” said
Mrs. Thorpe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know. Sales are such queer things.
You’d think”—Mrs. Will lowered her voice
still further and glanced at Andy’s back—“you’d
think sometimes when you get home with a lot of
rubbish you’ve no use for, that you’d been <span class='it'>possessed</span>.”
She paused. “I shall bid for the
jelly glasses. I remember thinking I should like
them the last time we had supper here before Mr.
Simpson’s illness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you, now?” said Mrs. Thorpe. “Well,
I thought the same about the glass dishes on that
very night. Last party they gave before he was
taken ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet they were good women, and would
do the widow and her children a thousand kindnesses.
It is such things that make the dullest-seeming
person so tremendously interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finger-bowls!” said Mrs. Will Werrit,
touching one with a scornful finger. “No wonder
he died in debt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they were a wedding——” began
Mrs. Thorpe, but a great trampling of feet announced
that the auctioneer was coming downstairs,
and with a hasty “Now, stick to your
place; don’t let yourself be pushed into a corner,”
the two ladies prepared gleefully for the conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy grew very tired indeed of waiting, as one
thing after another was knocked down to flushed
and excited buyers. The auctioneer was a kind-hearted
man, and went out of his way to try and
make the best price he could of the things, cracking
jokes with a bad headache in a stentorian
voice, which may not be a picturesque sacrifice
upon the altar of charity, but is a very real one,
all the same. And he understood his audience so
well that he had them all in high good-humour,
ready to bid for anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” he remarked, “we come to the
sideboard. You’re not like the greedy boy who
said, ‘Best first for fear I can’t hold it.’ I kept
the best until the last, sure that the spacious
residences of those I see around me <span class='it'>could</span> hold it,
and find it the greatest ornament of their homes.”
He put his hand to his head, feeling he was getting
muddled. “Ladies—it’s not drink—it’s
love! I meant to say this exquisite sideboard in
solid mahogany, plate-glass back, will be the chief
ornament of <span class='it'>some</span> home: for to my regret only
one of you can possess it.” He paused. How
his head ached! “Now, what shall I say for
this magnificent piece of furniture fit for a ducal
palace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five pounds,” said a red-faced man near the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five pounds! You offer the paltry sum of
five pounds for this magnificent sideboard, which
contains a cellaret for the wedding champagne
and a cupboard for the christening cake! Ladies
and gentlemen——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw himself, as it were, upon their better
feelings. And several people who did not
want the sideboard began to bid for it as if their
happiness in life depended upon their getting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five pounds ten! Six pounds! Seven
pounds ten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eight!” said Andy, beginning to be awfully
excited too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eight ten!” said Mrs. Will Werrit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine!” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine ten!” said a new voice—clear, and
yet breathless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten pounds!” said Andy, glaring in the
direction of the voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten ten!” and the crowd opened, leaving a
little space around a girl who seemed to bloom
suddenly upon the dull background of oldish faces
like an evening primrose on the twilight. She
was pale with the fear of being late and the excitement
of arriving just in time, and she waited
with parted lips for Andy’s defiant “Eleven!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other buyers had all stopped bidding, and
her quick “Eleven ten!” rang clear across a
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve!” said Andy, doggedly fixing his
chin into his collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve ten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirteen!” said Andy, looking at his opponent
with extreme distaste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirteen ten!” responded she, catching her
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fourteen!” shouted Andy, who had actually
forgotten both the sideboard and Mrs. Simpson,
and only felt that he would sell his shirt rather
than let this girl conquer him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fourteen ten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen ten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sixteen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back and forth rang the words like pistol
shots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nineteen ten!” They were both pale
now, and trembling with excitement. An electric
thrill ran through the room, a strange spirit hovered
almost visibly about the commonplace group
in the farmhouse parlour, and the auctioneer recognised
it easily enough and without surprise,
for he had grown used to knowing that men and
women touch the borders of the Inexplicable at
little country sales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy had the ‘twenty-one’ ready on his lips,
when, instead of the expected retort, there was
a moment’s silence that could be felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going at twenty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, won’t any one give another ten shillings
for this exceptionally handsome sideboard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going—going—gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hammer fell, and with that sound the two
young people stared at each other with a sort of
odd surprise, as if they had just awakened from
a queer dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Miss Elizabeth Atterton,” whispered
Mrs. Thorpe to Andy as he began to push his way
out, marvelling at his own folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty pounds was a ridiculous sum for him to
have paid for the thing in any case, and just now
when he was so short of money it was sheer
lunacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Elizabeth Atterton,” he said vaguely—“oh,
the young lady who bid against me? I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he made arrangements for the delivery
of the sideboard, and went home to find a dapper,
middle-aged gentleman walking down the drive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How-de-do. Just been to call on you. Sorry
to find you out,” said the dapper gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do come in,” said Andy, “and have a cup
of tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry I can’t. But I’ll go back with you for
a few minutes, if I may. Fact is, I told my
daughter to bring the cart round here for me at
four. She’s gone off to a sale or something.
Queer taste. But it’s better than developing
nerves. If a female of my household developed
nerves I should—er—duck her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sensible plan,” said Andy, wisely shaking his
head. “Most women are as full of fancies as an
egg is full of meat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so, just so,” said the dapper gentleman,
sitting very straight. And thus they disposed of
the mystery and tragedy of womanhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Elizabeth Atterton is here with the cart,
sir,” said the little maid, putting her head in at
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, my daughter’s here early,” said Mr.
Atterton, rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy accompanied him to the cart, where Miss
Elizabeth Atterton stood holding the head of a
rather restive pony. The light shone full on her
face, showing most clearly the gold in her brown
hair and in her eyes and in her exquisite skin,
which was of a deep cream with a faint red in the
cheeks-not at all like milk and roses, but like
some perfect fruit grown in the youth of the
world. Her features were irregular, the upper
lip being rather too long and the nose broad and
short, but her forehead and her eyes were very
lovely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter Elizabeth,” said Mr. Atterton,
as Andy took the pony’s head. “Oh, by the way,
my gloves,” and he bolted back to fetch them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I ran the price of your sideboard
up,” said Elizabeth stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said Andy, with equal stiffness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Atterton came out, and the little
cart clattered away through the lilac-scented afternoon.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Nothing</span> could be less like a messenger of Fate
than a mahogany sideboard with a plate-glass
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s Mrs. Simpson’s little girl for the third
time since seven!” said Mrs. Jebb, coming hastily
into the room, with ribbon-strings all aflutter
about her, as usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does she want?” said Andy, buttering
his toast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something about a sideboard,” said Mrs.
Jebb, poised, as it were, upon one hand at the
table corner. “Three times before breakfast
about a sideboard! You really must make a
stand, or you will never have a minute to call
your own. You are too good-natured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she turned her head slightly, so as to give
Andy the benefit of that glance which the late
Mr. Jebb found irresistible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” said Andy. “It’s what I’m paid
for;” and he rustled his letters together, carefully
avoiding the amorous eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As your aunt remarked, in engaging my services,”
said Mrs. Jebb, “it is a great thing for you
to have a lady in the house. I hope you will let
me help you in any way that I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. I’ll go round to Mrs. Simpson’s
at once,” said Andy, leaving an excellent corner
of the buttered toast. “By the way, I should
like my potatoes soft in the middle if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Anything you wish, please mention
at once,” said Mrs. Jebb. Nothing could
subdue her gaiety upon this summer morning,
when the birds were singing, and the sun was shining,
and Hope threw wreaths upon the tombstone
of Mr. Jebb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy glared at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing more at present, thank you,”
he said, going out; then Mrs. Jebb went to the
window and looked after him with an easy tear in
her eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impetuous,” she murmured, “impetuous, but
<span class='it'>sweet</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could Andy but have heard her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, by this time he was already entering
the little garden before Mrs. Simpson’s cottage at
the lane end, and all his thoughts were engrossed
by the unexpected sight of the famous sideboard
standings in sections around the creeper-covered
doorway. The widow sat weeping on an empty
box near that part containing the cellaret, while
a dark, anxious-looking little girl of about six
stood pulling her mother’s sleeve, and a big boy
of three hammered the little girl with broad, fat
fists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop that,” said Andy, seizing the boy from
behind; but the culprit turned on him such a jolly,
good-natured smile that he was disarmed, and
only said lamely—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shouldn’t hit your little sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t got nobody elth to hit,” lisped the
cherub, looking up at Andy with blue-eyed surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t mind what he says,” interposed
Sally anxiously. “Boys are born naughty. They
can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy glanced at Mrs. Simpson, who still sat
with her face hidden, evidently overcome by her
feelings, and he braced himself for a scene of
tearful gratitude. It was unpleasant, but no
doubt inevitable, so the best thing to do was to
get it over as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H-hem! I see you got the sideboard all
right, Mrs. Simpson. I am afraid it would be
rather late last night before you received it, but
the carrier——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been sitting on this box since six, waiting
to see you,” interposed Mrs. Simpson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t! Don’t say a word more. I’m
only too delighted,” began Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing,” wept Mrs. Simpson, “to
be delighted about. It won’t go into the house.
And you can’t keep a sideboard in a garden. Oh,
I know you meant well, but this makes me realise
my comedown more than anything else that has
happened. After thinking I’d got it, it still has
to go all the same. I dreamt last night that rows
of great girls came up one after the other and
banged hot-water cans down on the polished top,
and when I wasn’t dreaming I was looking out of
the window to see if it rained. And Mrs. Werrit
will get my sideboard after all. And the Thorpe
family will say they were in the right not to buy
it in for me. And I shall look like a fool. I hate
people that always turn out to be right in the
end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very long speech for Mrs. Simpson,
who was usually neither tearful nor garrulous,
and Andy saw that the woman had been stirred
to the foundations of her being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do? If I could do anything?”
he said helplessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Simpson dabbed her eyes with a black-bordered
handkerchief and tried to pull herself
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never gave way like this before—not even
when my husband died. And you mustn’t think
me ungrateful. It was very kind indeed of you
to buy the sideboard for me. Only, you see how
it all is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, suppose we get the thing moved away
from here at once,” said Andy, ruefully surveying
the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Simpson looked at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one thing—but I don’t suppose you
would—one couldn’t expect——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” demanded Andy. “I’d do anything
I could, but I don’t see——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I was wondering if you could possibly
take care of it for me at the Vicarage until I did
get a house where there was room for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, splendid!” said Andy. “The very
thing. Of course I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid!” said Jimmy, butting at Andy’s
legs like a young goat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And mother can go across and shine it, can’t
she?” said Sally gravely. “She doesn’t never
let anybody shine it but herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she can,” said Andy, “and you too.
I have heaps of empty rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it must be in a room with a fire,” said
Mrs. Simpson, beginning to weep again. “It
would soon look different if it was put away in an
unoccupied room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not a piano,” smiled Andy. “Oh, it’ll be
all right in the drawing-room. That isn’t furnished
yet you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ought to be in a room with a fire,” persisted
Mrs. Simpson, setting her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my study is not large enough, and the
dining-room is fully furnished. I really could
not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I said not from very first. I
couldn’t expect it,” said Mrs. Simpson, rising
with resigned sadness. “Shall I let Mrs. Will
Werrit know, or will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Mrs. Simpson, I assure you it’ll be
<span class='it'>perfectly</span> all right,” urged Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you think so, Mr. Deane, and I’m
most grateful to you for what you’ve done. I’ll
drop a line to Mrs. Will Werrit at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to go into the cottage and Jimmy
set up a piercing yell, the tired little girl whimpered;
there were loose straw and paper blowing
desolately about the garden. It seemed most
melancholy to Andy, this everyday trouble of a
broken-up home. The dreariness of it pierced
through the young hope and glamour that surrounded
him, and for one dull moment he heard
the hopeless chant which underlies all life: “Is it
worth while? Is it worth while?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Andy stood there, staring blankly at the
dust and straw, the tasteful appearance of his
dining-room seemed quite suddenly to be a very
small thing—and he had thought it so tremendously
important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will put your sideboard into the dining-room,
then, until we find a better place for it,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that is good of you—though it’s an
ornament to any room,” said Mrs. Simpson,
brightening at once. “We must make some arrangement
by which it becomes your property altogether
if I die first,” she added, in a burst of
real gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Andy, driven to asserting himself
at last by the idea of being saddled with the sideboard
for life. “No. To that I will never
agree.” He paused. “But there’s no need to
talk about dying at present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Simpson dried her eyes, folded her
hands, and spoke with almost her wonted tranquillity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never know. Anybody would have taken
a lease of Mr. Simpson’s life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry I never knew your husband,” said
Andy, resuming his professional manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mrs. Simpson, “I don’t suppose
you’d have seen much of him if he’d been here.
He didn’t like the clergy. Not that he had anything
against them, but he didn’t like them.”
She paused, then, wishful to avoid offence, she
added: “It was just a matter of taste. He
never could eat oysters either, and they’re a delicacy,
as everybody knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Andy solemnly, his face
grave but his heart light with laughter, and the
dolorous chanting of the underworld forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life was a splendid thing—like the spring
morning—and something glorious must be round
the corner.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Stamford</span>, the wife of the Squire of the
parish, stood before the mantelpiece awaiting the
arrival of the new Vicar. She was a tall, spare
woman, and her garments always seemed to cling
to her, not because they couldn’t come off, but because
they dared not. Even in repose, Mrs.
Stamford always looked as if she had that moment
finished doing something energetic, or were
just about to start again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pleased to see you, Mr. Deane,” she said,
when Andy, very flat and shining about the head,
was ushered in. “Only got back a day or two
since, or we should have looked you up before.
Have you got settled down? How d’you like
Gaythorpe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fired these remarks with such directness
that Andy could not help feeling as if some one
had thrown something at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it immensely.” Then, after a moment’s
pause, and with a good deal of effort, “I
am more than grateful to you and Mr. Stamford——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all right; we’ll take that as read,”
interrupted Mrs. Stamford with a short laugh so
exactly like that of William the parrot that Andy
could not help having a bewildered feeling that
she would next begin to draw corks as well. However,
she looked towards the door behind her
guest instead, and remarked in a voice which she
kept for that one topic—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is my son, Dick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall young fellow, very like his mother, but
somehow indefinably weaker, came forward and
shook hands without effusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got settled down yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite, thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find it dullish, I expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—rather exciting, so far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young men took each other’s measure, and
then Dick Stamford said in a different tone—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come in and have a game of billiards
with me when you’ve nothing better to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, I shall be very pleased,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was queer how anxiously Mrs. Stamford had
looked from one to the other during the little
conversation, and more odd still that this tough,
unemotional woman should be unable to keep
back a long sigh of relief when it was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a turn in the garden until the others
turn up?” said Dick, after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the two young men went out, and a moment
later Mr. Stamford came into the room, limping
slightly, and walking with a stick. As he closed
the door he looked across anxiously at his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it will be a success. He has taken Mr.
Deane round the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder, Ellen, if we ought not to have let
him remain in the Guards. He showed no tendency
to drink when he was with his regiment, so
far as I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stamford’s mouth set into those firm lines
her husband knew so well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was his duty to come home and look after
things when your accident made you unable to do
so. He will be master here. He must learn how
to manage the estate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Stamford smiled at his wife, and it could
be seen then whence Dick’s weakness came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wanted him home, Ellen, and so did I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should never have suggested it if I had not
thought it the right thing,” said Mrs. Stamford,
flushing a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not—of course not,” agreed her
husband. “Young companionship is all he needs,
and I think Mr. Deane will supply that deficiency.
It was his open look and pleasant, manly tone that
struck me when I first heard him preach. ‘Just
the sort of young fellow to make a nice companion
for Dick,’ I said to myself.” He rubbed his hands
together as he repeated this little story for the
hundredth time, after the manner of people who
live deep in the country and have little to talk
about. “I went straight to my cousin after the
service and asked if the lad wouldn’t do for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your cousin thought it an unsuitable appointment.
He wanted you to take the senior curate,”
said Mrs. Stamford, “and in some ways he was
quite right. Of course this boy can’t preach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Mr. Stamford chuckled. “I believe,
though, he thinks he got the living on account of
that sermon about Saul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, so long as he doesn’t preach more
than half an hour <span class='it'>I</span> don’t care what he says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both smiling as the two young men
came in through the glass door, and then luncheon
was announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Atterton and Elizabeth can’t be coming,”
said Mrs. Stamford, glancing at the clock.
“Anyhow, we won’t wait any longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they went across the spacious old hall into
a dining-room where everything was so harmonious
and so mellowed by long companionship, that
you noticed the various objects in it at first no
more than you do, at first sight, the details of any
beautiful thing which has grown and not been
made. Mr. Stamford himself was no more
conscious of his treasure-house than he was of the
nose upon his face. He was, of course, in some
hidden place, proud of both. The nose was the
best kind of nose, and the house was the best kind
of house, and it would have been incongruous if a
Stamford of Gaythorpe Manor had been provided
with a nose or a house that was less than the
best; but he felt no more inclination to draw his
visitor’s attention to his surroundings than to his
nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cold beef, please,” said Andy, in answer to
the butler’s discreet inquiries; and when the man
returned with quite a mountain of thins slices on
the plate he felt too much of a stranger to offer
any remonstrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stamford gave the man an imperceptible
nod of approval, for it had already penetrated
to her ears—as such things do penetrate in country
places—that the new Vicar had an enormous
appetite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy wrestled with the cold beef, all unheeding,
for it takes a lifetime to learn—and
some happy ones never learn—how different are
people’s thoughts of us from what we imagine
they must be—not worse, necessarily, or better,
but so extraordinarily different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a cart went past the window to the front
door and they all looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth at last. Dick!” said his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man left his luncheon and went, with
more alertness than Andy had supposed him
capable of, to welcome the belated guest. A
minute later he returned with her, and Mr. and
Mrs. Stamford both glanced with pleased eyes
at the tall, gallant-looking couple who came down
the long room together. Evidently, felt Andy,
there was something in the air, though he saw,
when Elizabeth sat down, that she had no engagement
ring on her finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry to be late,” she said, “but at
the last moment mamma’s back gave way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how unfortunate; but I quite understand,”
responded Mrs. Stamford, more nearly
gushing than Andy could have believed possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hoped Mrs. Atterton’s back had been better
of late,” said Mr. Stamford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Stamford added, to draw the
stranger into the conversation, “Poor Mrs. Atterton
is troubled with a weak back, Mr. Deane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus was Andy introduced to that feature of
Gaythorpe society—Mrs. Atterton’s back. He
looked across at Elizabeth and remembered
vividly his first sight of her, shining out, as it
were, between the drab, middle-aged crowd,
and his secret resentment against her was increased.
She obviously had everything; it must
have been simply a childish desire to ‘best’ him
which had led her to bid against him until he
was obliged to pay some pounds more than he
need have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how,” said Elizabeth, leaning towards
him, “do you like Gaythorpe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question did not surprise him, because it
would have been much more unusual at this period
if any one had failed to ask it; but what did
astonish him was the change in Elizabeth’s manner
from the extreme stiffness of their last parting
to an eager kindness that made Andy say to himself,
with some pleasant feeling of man-of-the-worldness,
that she was evidently the sort who
would flirt with a broomstick if nothing else were
available. <span class='it'>He</span> had known that kind in London
town. And he winked to himself astutely over
the fruit-tart as he responded to her overtures
with some reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After luncheon they all went into the garden,
and just for a moment, while Dick fetched the
key of one of the fruit-houses, and Mrs. Stamford
was settling her husband in his long chair, Andy
and the young lady were alone together on a
broad grass walk beside a hedge of lilacs. There
was a border of flowering plants on the other side
just coming into bloom, and at the end you could
see a little figure of Love without an arm under a
copper beech. Somewhere in the distance a pigeon
was cooing. The full sun lay very calm and
bright and even over the old stable tower and the
long house, and the grass path before them. The
stable clock chimed a quarter to three. It all
seemed the very embodiment of age-long prosperity
and pleasant ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy felt at peace with all the world. She
could flirt with him if she liked—he didn’t
care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re fond of walking?” he said indulgently,
continuing a topic started at luncheon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, staring at the grass path.
Then she put out a hand, not touching him, only
nearly, and the colour in her cheeks deepened
until they were like some exquisite fruit that a
young sun had kissed in orchards that belonged
to the youth of the world. But Elizabeth was
always greatly annoyed at her trick of blushing,
and compared herself bitterly to a beetroot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were going to say!” remarked Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there’s Mr. Stamford coming. I must
tell you. I’ve been to see Mrs. Simpson,” said
Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” said Andy, taken aback.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wanted it for her. And I bid against
you until you had to pay pounds more than you
need have done. And you must have had so
many expenses getting into your house. And it
was all so idiotic of me. My sister always says
I’m an idiot, and I am. I only stopped when I
did because I hadn’t another penny until next
July.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why”—Andy stood still, facing her, and the
most wonderful scent from all the sun-warmed
lilacs blew across them—enveloped them—“why—you
wanted it for Mrs. Simpson too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You surely couldn’t think,” said Elizabeth,
“that I wanted that beast for <span class='it'>myself</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You thought I did,” muttered Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—a man—that’s different,” said Miss
Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My furniture is all Sheraton—modern, of
course, but good in style,” said Andy loftily.
Then he saw Elizabeth’s hair against the lilacs,
all brown and gold, and something made him forget
he was the new Vicar—he was a boy and she a
girl, with a joke between them. “I say,” he
chuckled, “you know it wouldn’t go into her
house. She’s made me put her sideboard into my
dining-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ha-ha-ha! They laughed together for the first
time, and the sound mingled with the rustling
of young leaves and the love-song of a thrush, as
much a part of the sweetness of nature in springtime
as the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Dick Stamford came towards them with
his mother, and Elizabeth slipped her arm
through that of the elder woman with her little
air of reposeful tenderness which sat almost oddly
on a young girl. She had that sort of kindness in
her ways which most girls only learn from their
first baby, and her voice held deep notes which
caught the heart every now and then, breaking
her light chatter like a stone in a narrow stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll stay tea, Elizabeth, and then Dick
shall take you home,” said Mrs. Stamford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m awfully sorry, but I must have the cart
round in half an hour. Mamma’s back——”
apologised Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So mamma’s back was not only a convenience
to herself, personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Andy said good-bye, and Mrs. Stamford,
leaving Dick and Elizabeth alone, strolled down
the drive with her other guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find Gaythorpe very quiet,” said
Mrs. Stamford at the gate, obviously thinking of
something else, and yet lingering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy glanced back at it all, and a sudden vivid
picture of the tumult of things warring beyond
this quiet place struck across his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This seems——” He sought a way to say it,
but none came. “This does seem quiet.” He
tried again. “Seems as if it had been lived in
easily for ages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um. Well, people have no leisure to live
now; they’ve only time to make a living,” said
Mrs. Stamford absently. Then she said what she
had been meaning to say all down the drive. “My
son is a great deal alone here in the evenings.
More alone than is good for him. I shall be
grateful if you will come in when you can and
have a game of billiards. You play, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes—we had a couple of tables at the
Men’s Institute in my last parish. I shall be very
pleased to come,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he went away down the road, feeling that
pleasant as the world had been that morning
early, it was immensely more delightful now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two urchins watched him go up the road, then
squashed disreputable hats down on their brows
and began to imitate his professional stride which
he had unconsciously copied on first arrival in
London from the senior curate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parson Andy walks like this! Parson Andy
walks like this!” they chanted together under
their breath, stepping down the road behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For by this abbreviation was the Reverend
Andrew Deane already known to his parishioners.
It was inevitable, of course, but as yet he remained
in blissful ignorance of the fact, and only the night
before had secretly burned a satin tie-case on
which a tactless cousin had embroidered ‘Andy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he went across the churchyard, taking the
short-cut home, he glanced once more at the
gravestone of Gulielmus; and having glanced, he
stood a moment, thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was most probable that this dead brother of
his had been entertained by a Stamford of Gaythorpe
Manor, just as he had been. Will Ford—who
was now Gulielmus—had no doubt walked
back by the very path beside which his body now
lay sleeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had he felt? Why had he never married?
How had life gone with him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy was standing very still in the warm quiet
of the spring afternoon when suddenly a sense
of jolly-good-fellowship and kindness seemed to
fill his spirit—as if some comrade had passed that
way and shouted a merry greeting. There was
nothing strange or abnormal about it, either then
or in the ineffaceable after-remembrance of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only—Andy had felt on his first journey to
Gaythorpe as if, across the centuries, he greeted a
brother; now he felt as if, across the centuries, a
brother greeted him.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Andy</span> sat in his study, endeavouring to prepare
a Sunday-morning sermon that should justify the
high opinion of his preaching which had led Mr.
Stamford to present him to the living of Gaythorpe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light rain fell outside and a scent of the
honeysuckle—it being now June—came through
the open window; but Andy was not yet aware
that every wayside flower preaches the finest sermon
man can preach to man, and says, more convincingly
than any parson ever could, ‘God so
loved the world.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new Vicar, therefore, had taken in turn
such topics as the Origin of Evil and the Reason
for Free Will, handling them with a courage perfectly
remarkable when you consider how the
saints of all ages have hesitated afraid before
them. This morning, however, having settled
these questions, he cast about him for something
else which should be at once striking and profound,
and it was some time before he noticed a
gradually increasing noise in the other part of the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even when he did become aware of it he
brushed it aside from his mind and went peacefully
on, reconciling the doctrine of evolution with
the second chapter of Genesis. At last, however,
the study door was burst open in a manner that
even a poet could not ignore, and Mrs. Jebb
paused, inarticulate with some unknown emotion,
upon the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Not</span> the boiler burst again?” exclaimed
Andy, who had already learned some of the trials
of a housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb swallowed, blinked, and demanded—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you give that—female—permission to
clean my furniture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long way from the dawn of the world
to Mrs. Simpson’s sideboard, and for the moment
Andy felt nonplussed; then he remembered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s turned up to polish it, poor woman,
has she?” he said, with an air of relief. “I told
her she could. It’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb fluttered forward, wavering a little
like a butterfly that has imbibed too much nectar,
and she alighted with one trembling hand upon
the writing-table edge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not all right,” she said. “It is all very,
very wrong, Mr. Deane. Poor, I am, reduced to
domestic service, I may be—but I will retire to
the workhouse before I will allow a female from
outside to polish furniture in this house while I
remain your lady-cook-housekeeper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Mrs. Jebb—I’m sure I never——”
began Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will the parish say?” went on Mrs.
Jebb, growing still more agitated as she saw
Andy’s concerned face. “What will the world
say? Naturally that I’m not fit to be your housekeeper,
if Mrs. Simpson has to come with dusters
and furniture polish and an—an infant, to clean
the Vicar’s dining-room sideboard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dragging sound as of something being pulled
reluctantly along, a bump, a yell, and Mrs. Simpson’s
voice in the rear, shrill with motherly indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dare you call this dear child names?”
she cried, replying to the limitless opprobrium
which lay behind the word ‘infant’ rather than
to the term itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come,” said Andy, rising. “He is an
infant all right, aren’t you, Jimmy? Not twenty-one
yet, ha-ha! There is nothing unpleasant in
the word ‘infant.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled ingratiatingly from one angry face
to the other, trying to carry it off easily, but in
truth as frightened as a decent young man
always is when he stands between two quarrelling
women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a way,” replied Mrs. Simpson slowly,
glaring with her prominent light-blue eyes at Mrs.
Jebb—“there’s a way of saying ‘woman’ that
implies things I wouldn’t sully my lips by uttering.
And yet ‘woman’ isn’t a bad word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all comes to this,” panted Mrs. Jebb. “Is
Mrs. Simpson to walk in without a with-your-leave
or a by-your-leave and start polishing your
sideboard, or is she not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s <span class='it'>her</span> sideboard,” said Andy weakly. “But
I’m sure you’ll look after it all right, if Mrs.
Simpson doesn’t mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should she mind? And if it’s hers, why
doesn’t she take it away? Dozens of times I’ve
said that the hideous thing completely ruins your
dining-room, and I’m sure——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” interposed Mrs. Simpson, who grew,
quiet as her opponent grew noisy, “<span class='it'>now</span> I shall
say what I’d meant to keep to myself, because
Mrs. Jebb has her living to earn, poor thing, and
I wouldn’t do her an injury. That sideboard in
its present state, Mr. Deane, is a disgrace. So
is your beautiful table. So is all the furniture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It only wants dusting. We’ve not had time
this morning,” quavered Mrs. Jebb, retreating
before this onslaught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wants what you’ll never give it,” said Mrs.
Simpson, hauling Jimmy away, and looking back
for a last shot. “It wants elbow-grease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” said Andy, pulling himself together.
“I—er—really—discord in a clergyman’s
house is what I greatly dislike. Mrs. Jebb,
I told Mrs. Simpson she could come and clean her
sideboard. Mrs. Simpson, you must put yourself
in Mrs. Jebb’s place and consider if your feelings
might not have been hurt under similar circumstances.
This really won’t do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw his head back, settled his chin in his
collar, and looked as nearly like the senior curate
before a refractory Bible Class as nature permitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Simpson paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came peacefully enough,” she said, “and
I was going to tell Mrs. Jebb, only she went off
at such a tangent, that I did ring five times. But
I couldn’t make any one hear, so I walked into
the hall. Then I saw the dining-room door open,
and nobody there, so I went in <span class='it'>there</span> and started
polishing. I’ll own it may have looked funny, but
she shouldn’t have spoken as she did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! That makes all the difference.
Doesn’t it, Mrs. Jebb?” said Andy eagerly, forgetting
to be dignified. “I say, shake hands and
make it up. Jimmy, shake hands with Mrs. Jebb
to start with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t. Hate her. She’s got yeller teef like
old Towzer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, hush,” said Mrs. Simpson, changing
all in a minute from the fighting woman to the
careful mother. “Jimmy mustn’t talk like that.
Jimmy must beg the lady’s pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t,” said that gentleman truculently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy must do as he’s told,” said Mrs.
Simpson, then, grasping the pudgy little hand
firmly, she held it out to the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I’ve no wish——” began Mrs. Jebb,
with trembling stateliness, when Andy cast aside
the mantle of the senior curate, grabbed Mrs.
Jebb’s hand in his own, and pushed the bony
fingers of his lady-cook-housekeeper towards
Jimmy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he exclaimed boyishly, “you can’t
refuse to shake hands with a little chap like
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb felt the touch of the firm, young
fingers on her wrist, weakened, advanced a step,
finally ‘eye-cornered’ Andy with a tremulous
smile and waggled once the fat hand of Master
Simpson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure,” she said, “I’ve no wish to be
un-neighbourly, Mrs. Simpson. It was just seeing
you there on your knees rubbing the sideboard
front when I never expected to see anything but
the cat or Mr. Deane. I ought to be able to enter
into a widow’s feelings if anybody ever could.
With Mr. Jebb I was not merely a wife, I was
an obsession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all my wordly goods I thee endow, of
course,” quoted Mrs. Simpson vaguely, in whose
mind the words possession and obsession had
somehow run together and produced a blurred
impression of Mrs. Jebb’s meaning. But she saw
Andy was anxious for peace, and gratitude for the
sideboard gradually overcoming her anger, she
wished to do her part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two widows living near together should be
on good terms,” said Mrs. Jebb, her annoyance
also cooling, while prudence dictated a course obviously
pleasing to Andy. “Will you step into
my room and have a cup of tea? I am no breakfast-eater,
and generally take one at eleven.
And”—she concluded the amend generously,
“Jimmy shall have a biscuit with pink sugar on
the top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That settled it; for Jimmy was so fond of
eating that he would have accompanied the sweep—his
idea of the embodiment of evil—to search
for biscuits with pink sugar on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the baize door of the study banged in the
rear of an amicable trio while Andy sat down and
mopped his brow. It was difficult to catch evolution
by the tail after that—he seemed to have
gone so far from it. But he knitted his brow,
shook his fountain-pen, and started on the quest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thought, however, would creep in and out
of the books of reference and between the written
words—it was not so easy as it looked, to live in a
place where everybody was so inextricably mixed
up with everybody else. And later in the day
he was to have another striking proof of this
queer inter-independence of which a townsman
knows so little. For when he walked past the
Petches’ cottage he beheld the Attertons’ landau,
drawn by a sleek and fat pair of horses and driven
by a sleek and fat coachman, standing in front of
the little gate. Elizabeth Atterton and an ample
lady in grey occupied the carriage, and they were
inspecting a parrot in a cage, which Mrs. Petch
rested on the step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust,” said Mrs. Atterton, “that William
is in good health. He looks”—she paused—
“he looks far from well, Emma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moulting, ’m,” said Mrs. Petch. “That’s
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this is not the season for moulting,” objected
Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Mrs. Petch, with an easy smile,
“but William always was different to other birds.
Scores and hundreds of times I’ve heard my poor
mistress say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it was a remark my poor aunt often
made,” said Mrs. Atterton, eyeing the dejected
attitude and naked chest of the parrot doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you give him every attention. You
would, of course, when your annuity dies with
him. My poor aunt no doubt felt that.” She
paused again, and added in answer to Mrs.
Petch’s look of wounded innocence, “Of course,
you would in any case. I do not forget what a
devoted maid you were to poor Aunt Arabella.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She trusted me with William,” said Mrs.
Petch simply, applying the corner of her apron
to her eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. I was not reflecting on you in any
way, of course, Emma,” said Mrs. Atterton
kindly. “Only, I promised to see after William
sometimes, and I like to do it. Poor William!
Of course, one can’t expect him to live for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parrots sometimes live to be a hundred,”
said Mrs. Petch quickly. “Sam read that in the
paper only the other day, ’m.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll hope William may,” said Mrs.
Atterton comfortably. “I never liked him, even
in his best days, but I don’t want him to die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a reposeful kindness about Mrs.
Atterton that seemed exactly like that of her
daughter Elizabeth—and yet, in its essence it was
altogether different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, sir,” said Mrs. Petch, long
before Andy reached the group. She greeted him
with such alacrity, indeed, that an enemy might
have thought she welcomed the interruption to
the interview with William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mamma, here is Mr. Deane. Mr. Deane,
you haven’t met my mother?” said Elizabeth,
who was, for some foolish and obscure reason, a
little nervous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—er—I am very glad—that is—I am
sorry—at least, I mean to say I am delighted to
meet you now,” said Andy, who, for some equally
foolish and obscure reason, was nervous too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Atterton beamed placidly on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry I did not see you when you called,
Mr. Deane, but it was one of my bad days. My
back——” She paused, as if that explained all,
and Andy filled in the blank with a sympathetic—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I’m afraid you are a great sufferer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Mrs. Atterton pleasantly, “it is
not that I have any great pain, but I collapse.
Don’t I, Elizabeth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma is so patient,” said Elizabeth, with
loving sincerity. “She hates to make us
feel——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, come! Bring that cup of tea!
Bring that cup of tea!” interrupted William,
croaking hideously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Aunt Arabella! Couldn’t you fancy
you heard her voice from the grave?” murmured
Mrs. Atterton, shedding an easy tear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William belonged to my great-aunt, Mr.
Deane,” explained Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it swept over Andy again with renewed
force, how everybody here was connected in some
way with everybody else. He had always known
in a general way, of course, as we all do, that if
you slip on a banana skin and use expressions better
left unemployed you may influence some one
for evil in central China—but he had never before
come near enough to the principle to be able to
see the working of it with the naked eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought when I first came to Gaythorpe
that William was a person,” said Andy, noticing
the pink nails of Elizabeth’s ungloved hand upon
the carriage door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, poor Aunt Arabella always did say he
had an immortal soul—and you never know,”
said Mrs. Atterton, willing to give everything
created the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the fat coachman, who was tired of waiting,
made one of his fat charges stamp idly on the
ground in a perfunctory manner, and Mrs. Atterton
said the horses were growing restive and it
was time to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So glad we are to see you on Thursday evening,”
she said, over her shoulder. “Good-bye,
Mr. Deane. Good afternoon, Emma. Let me
know how William is, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farewells of Andy and Elizabeth were
somehow merged in the salutations of Mrs. Atterton,
and the responses of Mrs. Petch, but they
looked at each other just as the carriage went off
with a direct glance which held more than either
of them could yet understand of young hope and
joy and question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it?” that look said. They didn’t
know—they didn’t know—only something glorious!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stood staring after the carriage until at
last Mrs. Petch’s voice from behind penetrated
his understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cars are all very well,” she said, “but there
<span class='it'>is</span> a something about a carriage and pair—however,
they <span class='it'>own</span> motor-cars—it isn’t that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy understood that the wealth and standing
of the Atterton family were being defended, and
replied at once—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. All the same, I can’t understand
when you have a Limousine——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Atterton’s back won’t stand motor-cars,”
said Mrs. Petch gravely, but if so perfectly
behaved a gardener’s wife could have ever
winked, Andy would have said she winked then.
However, he felt the light must have dazzled his
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so,” he said. “It is a great affliction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. It is, indeed,” responded Mrs.
Petch at once. “Everything in life, as you may
say, and yet a back to spoil it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s always—er—something,” said Andy,
feeling he ought to improve the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is, indeed,” sighed Mrs. Petch, with a
sort of serious cheerfulness. “No rose without a
thorn in this world, sir, and we can’t expect any
different. We should never want to go to another
if we’d everything we wanted here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice, right-thinking woman!” reflected
Andy, as he went up the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was on his way to visit a woman called old
Mrs. Werrit, an obscure connection of the Werrit
family who had drifted near them again in her
extreme old age, and Andy had been told that day
that she was dying. But he was ready enough
to help any old person to die, just as he was ready
to help any young one to live, and he went up
some crooked stairs to the bedroom, full of confidence
in himself and his office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time the old woman said nothing in
response to his remarks, and allowed a daughter
of Mrs. Will Werrit’s to answer for her. Maggie
Werrit felt rather glad that her aged relative
was not in a talkative mood because she lacked
that polish which the best boarding-school in Bardwell
had imparted to the latest generation of the
family, and the new Vicar would look down on
them all if he heard one of them talk about
‘ankerchers.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you don’t suffer much?” said Andy,
sitting down beside the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Werrit opened her eyes, and he was
surprised to find how full of life they were in that
sunken, dull old face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did suffer,” she said, “but that’s over now,”
and she shut her eyes again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy took out his little book and prepared to
read, when Mrs. Werrit looked at him once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The others are all gone first,” she said.
“Every one of us six but me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” said Andy, very gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t be,” said old Mrs. Werrit. “It
doesn’t matter now.” She paused, and added after
a moment, “You’ll find out—all that matters at
the very end—is how near you’ve gotten to God
in your life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she closed her eyes again, and Andy shut
his little book and put it in his pocket without a
word, and crept reverently down the crooked
stairs as if he were leaving the presence of some
one very great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was far down the village street, and
too far from the little house to go back again, he
realised that, for the first time in his professional
career, he had failed in his ministration to the
aged poor. He fingered his little book, feeling
inclined to go back again, and all the way home
something within him smarted and burned underneath
his wandering thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Youth knows nothing more unpleasant than
those secret growing pains of the soul of which it
does not understand the meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was these—or it might have been
the dull evening after a day of clouds and storms—anyway,
Andy felt driven forth after supper
to tramp restlessly up and down the garden path
by the churchyard hedge. Had he chosen the right
life? Was he fitted for a country parson?</p>

<p class='pindent'>New and perplexing doubts of himself began to
assail him for the first time as he tramped up and
down, casting a glance at Brother Gulielmus
every now and then over the churchyard hedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had he tramped up and down here too? For
the garden dated back to that time, though the
house was modern. Had he wondered and felt
restless too?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But gradually the regular motion quieted
Andy’s nerves, and he began to notice how the
crimson rambler had grown, and to feel the freshness
of the dew-laden air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, quite suddenly, for no reason at all,
he remembered with wonderful vividness how
Elizabeth’s hand had looked upon the door of
the carriage. His mental picture of her face was
indistinct, but her hand seemed painted on the
summer darkness, and he felt an intense longing
to take it in his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all he wanted—so exquisite a thing is
the first beginning of young love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Deane! Mr. Deane! Will you have
eggs and bacon for breakfast, or the rest of the
cold ham?” shrilled Mrs. Jebb from the doorstep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just as you like. I’ve told you so before,”
said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I <span class='it'>like</span> to consult your tastes,” said Mrs.
Jebb pathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eggs and bacon, then,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s damp under foot,” said Mrs. Jebb. Then
something in the woman’s voice and look as she
tried to keep him there for company struck home
to Andy’s perceptions, and he suddenly realised
that she might be dull and lonely too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say—it’s awfully good of you to bother
about my tastes like that. You mustn’t think I
don’t appreciate it,” he said eagerly. “Those
gooseberry dumplings we’ve been having are
fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now Mr. Jebb couldn’t assimilate boiled
paste at any price,” began Mrs. Jebb, delighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy listened to her for quarter of an hour
and then went back to the path by the churchyard
hedge and that dream which Mrs. Jebb had interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or perhaps it was scarcely a dream as yet—only
the indescribably delicate stuff of which
dreams are made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually, however, the quietness of all about
Andy seemed to fit in with his misty memories
of Elizabeth. Tenderness. Sweetness. Repose.
Why—those meant Elizabeth—they were but
other names for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Words gathered in his mind, singing of themselves
about her sweetness. The nightingale in a
little wood half a mile away was no more singing
to his mate than Andy there, beneath the churchyard
hedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only, the nightingale’s song was lovely for
every one, and Andy’s could never be lovely for
any one but Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pictured them, hand in hand, there in the
garden together, watching the village as it went
to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg pardon, sir. Didn’t see you. Churchyard’s

Petch, blundering through the gate in the hedge.
“Beautiful night, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam was not uproariously drunk, but he was
affably so, and took no notice of Andy’s frigid—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will speak with you in the morning, Petch.
Go home at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho I will, sir. Sho I will,” said Sam heartily.
“An’thing to oblige. Good-night, sir.”
He paused, then looked back and said pleasantly,
“Had a bit o’ bad luck on my way home, sir.
Wife sent me for sixpennoth o’ brandy for her
spasms, and I’ve broke the bottle. I suppose you
haven’t a drop you could——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Andy sternly. “Go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, sir. <span class='it'>Of</span> course. No offence
taken and none meant,” said Sam, moving off.
He paused again and added solemnly, “It’s a
great relief to me, after the way our poor late
Vicar went on, to find you don’t keep no spirits in
the house, sir. A great relief it is. Good-night.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> Andy went into the garden next morning
he buckled on tight the mantle of the senior curate
and advanced across the grass to where Sam
Petch was bending over a flower-bed with an air
of decent contrition. No skulking behind bushes
for him—he prodded dismally for all the world
to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy, in spite of himself, felt slightly mollified,
but he had made up his mind to say a certain
thing, and he said it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This state of things cannot continue. You
bring discredit on my profession, my parish, and
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There—that was it—just as the senior curate
would have put it; Andy took hold of his
coat lapel, coughed, and waited—just as the
senior curate would have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is one of those facts about human nature
which cannot be explained, that while Andy disliked
the senior curate exceedingly, and had
groaned under his oppressive rule, he strove to
imitate that gentleman. Perhaps he unconsciously
wanted people to be as much impressed by him
as he had been by the senior curate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyway, Sam Petch appeared to be greatly impressed
by the dignified rebuke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I own I’d had a drop too much,” he said repentantly.
“But Bill Shaw drank five times what
I did and never turned a hair. It shows how
unfair things is, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a little makes you drunk you must refrain
from that little,” said Andy, severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” acknowledged Sam. “But it is
hard when a man can’t take his mug o’ beer with
the rest without getting what you might call jolly;
isn’t it, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all—what is a mug of beer?” argued
Andy. “I’m not a total abstainer myself, but I
will become one if you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam’s potations of the previous night still hung
about him sufficiently to make him very irritable,
and he suddenly lost control of his temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very well talking like that,” he said.
“You, who don’t care whether you ever have
another drink or not—what do you know about
it? Give up the thing you like best and then I’ll
do the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy looked at the man, and the mantle of the
senior curate was blown away in the blast of truth
that swept across him. He even forgot to notice
the disrespectfulness of Sam’s manner as that
wind burst open a closed chamber in his mind and
he saw farther than he had ever done before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he said simply. “I like”—he
sought for his preference—“I like butter best
of anything—always did, as a little kid—I’ll
give up that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give up beer, then,” agreed Sam Petch;
but he made certain mental reservations of which
Andy, naturally, could know nothing. Every
man had a right to beer on a Saturday night, of
course; that was the privilege of a British working-man
which was above and beyond all other
agreements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Andy went back into the house with a
complete sense of failure dogging his footsteps.
It was a ridiculous and undignified thing to do, to
make a compact of that nature with a drunken
gardener. He ought to have insisted in a dignified
manner upon instant reform or instant dismissal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Jebb,” he said, looking in at the kitchen
door, “please do not send butter into the room
with my meals. I shall not be taking any for
some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? No butter?” said Mrs. Jebb.
“Are you bilious? Well, I know towards the
last Mr. Jebb never could——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I am dining out to-night,” continued
Andy, who was particularly disinclined, just then,
for Mr. Jebb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How convenient! I mean, how strange!”
said Mrs. Jebb. “I was just about to ask if you
would have any objection to my going over to
Millsby Hall this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—are you invited too?” said Andy,
very much astonished. “I mean, there’s no
reason why you should not be dining with the
Attertons, only I hadn’t heard——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once a lady always a lady, of course,” replied
Mrs. Jebb, smoothing her lace cravat.
“But the conventions of life are such that, as
lady-cook-housekeeper, I neither am, nor expect
to be, bidden to Mrs. Atterton’s table. I was
referring to the Long Night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave to the two last words such a melancholy
emphasis that Andy had a vague idea, for
the moment, that she was in some new way referring
to the demise of Mr. Jebb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The long night?” he echoed stupidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean the final evening of the Parish Dancing
Class,” said Mrs. Jebb, “which Mr. and Miss
Fanny Kirke have pressed me to attend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Andy. “I’d forgotten. It
is to be held at Millsby Hall, of course, so that
Mrs. Atterton may see the final practice of the
country dances for the Garden Fête next week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. and Miss Kirke told me in confidence,”
added Mrs. Jebb, with an indescribable air of
being ‘in the know,’ “that Mrs. Atterton’s back
would not permit of her coming to the village
schoolroom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Andy, to whom even the back of
the Beloved’s mamma was sacred. “Well, go,
by all means, Mrs. Jebb. I expect I shall see
you dancing like a girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My girlhood’s days are over,” sighed Mrs.
Jebb. “But”—she cheered up—“married
ladies are very popular in ballrooms now, I understand.
The gentlemen seem to like mature
conversation combined with their dancing. And
I do not intend to refuse. I think it neither
Christian nor right, Mr. Deane, for a widow to
make a suttee of herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” agreed Andy absently.
“Well—no butter—you quite understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust me,” said Mrs. Jebb effusively, “to
understand a gentleman’s inside. For months
before he died, Mr. Jebb——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy departed, and the recording angel put it
down to the right side of his everlasting account
that he did <span class='it'>not</span> say, “Damn Mr. Jebb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day seemed long, and the afternoon appeared
to stretch out interminably until the hour
when Andy could adorn himself in a new clerical
dress-suit which he now thanked the aunt and
cousins in Birmingham for insisting upon; thus
arrayed, he surveyed his newly plastered curls in
the looking-glass, and felt that, though severely
freckled and rather short than otherwise, he was
the right thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped jauntily in the cool of the evening
past Brother Gulielmus asleep, and never gave
him a thought, only wondering if he had buckled
his braces high enough, or if his trousers were,
after all, a shade too long. He paused behind the
yew at the corner to adjust matters, and gazed
down at his legs with a keen preoccupation that
left no room for anything else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt it was such an immensely important
thing that Elizabeth should see him with his
trousers exactly the right length, and he was very
much startled to hear a voice behind him saying
tentatively—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me—as a married lady—perhaps
I <span class='it'>might</span> oblige with a safety-pin——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb again!—taking the air in the congenial
neighbourhood of the tombstones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not daring to trust himself to speech, Andy
shook his head and marched out of the churchyard.
He began to hate Mrs. Jebb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he came in sight of Millsby Hall he
forgot all about her, and approached with beating
pulses the extremely ugly, modern house which
sheltered the lady of his dreams. It had been
built by Mr. Atterton’s father after he developed
from a small county landowner into the owner
of a watering-place. Marshaven, previously to
1850, had been the resort of fishermen and waterfowl
only; now it was crowded from June to
September with train-loads of trippers from all
over the country, and Mr. Atterton found the
joy and interest of his existence in supervising
the erection of ever-new rows of red-brick villas,
and in putting his finger into every pie which the
town council of that prosperous resort made for
the purpose of attracting visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe we’ve got that matter arranged with
the Bandmaster,” he said, rubbing his hands energetically
as he entered his drawing-room that
evening. “I did think for a time that the situation
looked serious, but I approached him informally
at first, and then officially, as the Chairman
of the ‘Amusements Committee,’ and I think
the crisis is over.” He paused, and smiled with
satisfaction at his assembled family. “I’m glad
to have my mind free for the Promenade question—that
will take some engineering—but of
one thing I am absolutely determined,”—he hit
one hand on the other—“I will <span class='it'>not</span> have blue
seats picked out with gold. I admit they may
look prosperous—that is the argument Smith
uses—but I dislike the idea. I cannot say why,
but I dislike it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your artistic sense suggests to you unconsciously
that they’ll make the sea look dirty,” said
his daughter Norah, glancing across at him with
the corners of her thin lips more mocking than
usual—and she always seemed to be making
game, a little contemptuously, of all that happened
at Millsby Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I hadn’t thought of that,” said Mr. Atterton
eagerly. “That will be an argument to
use at our next meeting. It polishes your wits
up, Norah, going about speaking in public as you
do—though I can’t say I always——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Deane,” said the servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, immediately afterwards—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Stamford. Mr. Richard Stamford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were only eight people in all, in the room,
but they seemed to Andy like a crowd each possessing
more than the normal number of feet,
and it was only after treading upon the toes of
Bill Atterton and then stepping back heavily upon
those of the divinity that he managed to pull himself
together sufficiently to realise that there was
ample space in the apartment for the feet of a
small army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very—er—hot for the time of year,” he
said to Dick Stamford, with whom he had become
more or less intimate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think so?” said Dick, as perfectly at his
ease as if this were the ordinary drawing-room
of commerce and not the shrine of a sacred lady.
“Well, I thought myself it was chilly. Had to
get a whisky before I came to warm me up a bit.
Funny thing,” he added, with unusual animation,
“but when I am cold whisky warms me, and
when I am warm it cools me. I think I must
have a peculiar constitution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I’ve met chaps like that before,”
said Andy, with a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so have I, of course. But it’s a rum
thing, all the same,” said Dick, looking at Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Deane,” said Mrs. Atterton, “this
is a family party, so we will just go in to dinner
informally. But as you are the only one who does
not know the way, you must come with me.” Then
when they were all settled she added pleasantly,
choosing a topic for Andy, “You’ll be sorry to
hear that we are anxious about William. He is
very ill. Elizabeth”—she spoke across the
table—“do remember to go and see how he is
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mamma,” said Elizabeth dutifully, from
the midst of a laughing conversation with Dick
Stamford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be a misfortune for the Petches if he
does die,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth is the one who really ought to go
to inquire,” said Mrs. Atterton vaguely; she was
watching to see how the new footman handed
the soup. “My poor Aunt Arabella was her godmother,
and left her a small fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear,” said Mr. Atterton from the other
end of the table, “that the Gaythorpe Dancing
Class is to be held in our ballroom to-night. What
next, Norah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to make quite sure that those girls
know how to dance before I ask a lot of people
down to the Garden Fête for the Children’s Hospital,”
said Norah. “As I’m getting the thing
up, I intend to see that it is properly done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter Norah,” said Mrs. Atterton,
leaning confidentially towards Andy, “has a genius
for organisation. Now, Elizabeth possesses
no particular talent that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy swallowed a piece of chicken hastily,
choked, turned very red, and blurted forth—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She always seems to be doing something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that was, of course, not at all what he really
meant to say. What he tried to bring out from
the chaotic ideas which surrounded Elizabeth in
his mind like the storm-clouds about a pictured
saint, was the fact that she did a great deal more
than exercise a talent—she created an atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Atterton glanced at his red face and said,
in her comfortable way—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a tough chicken, I’m afraid, Mr.
Deane. We always do have tough fowls, because
my husband will grow our own poultry, and
we put off killing them. You would be surprised
how attached they become to us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not surprised in the least,” said Andy,
with a very pleasant look, half bold, half shy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mrs. Atterton, who had her feelings,
though she did measure thirty-four inches round
the waist, smiled very kindly on her young guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hope you’ll like us, too, when you get
to know us,” she said. Then she turned to her
eldest daughter. “What time are we to join
the revels, Norah? I shall not be able to stay
long as my back is troubling me a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy felt very sorry to hear that, because Mrs.
Atterton had so enjoyed everything but the chicken
that he hoped her back was in abeyance; but
Norah’s reply showed rather a want of sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will your back last out for half an hour?”
she said. “Because, if so, we will do the country
dances from half-past nine to ten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do excellently. Then Martin can
bring me my cocoa to my room at ten. By the
way, Elizabeth, have you seen about the refreshments
for the Dancing Class?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it was Mrs. Atterton’s second daughter
who attended to the domestic arrangements of
the establishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mamma. Mrs. Smith knows all about
it,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you are giving them something decent,
Elizabeth,” said Norah. “I hold socialistic
principles, Mr. Deane, and I hate the bun-and-mug
system of entertaining so-called social inferiors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what are you giving them?” insisted
Norah, thinking she perceived a reluctance in her
sister’s reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the usual thing—sandwiches, creams,
fruit, hock-cup, iced coffee, strawberry ices——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” said Norah. “Ices? Quite unnecessary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know all the girls,” said Elizabeth, defending
herself. “I’ve played with Rose Werrit at
every school-treat since I could toddle. I wanted
them to have things they would like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re so sentimental, Elizabeth,” said
Norah lightly. “I can’t stand sentiment. Can
you, Mr. Deane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are as many kinds of sentiment as there
are of”—Andy paused for a simile, and concluded
somewhat lamely—“of sauce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth’s is the sweet kind, then, flavoured
with vanilla,” said Norah, with her little upward
curve of the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect yours is that tart kind like they have
with fried sole, Norah,” laughed Dick Stamford,
who had been on intimate terms with them all
since he was in petticoats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t got any,” said Norah. “Nor you,
either, Mrs. Stamford; have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a scrap,” said Mrs. Stamford, thinking
she was speaking the truth. “Still—it’s nice in
Elizabeth,” and she patted the girl’s round arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not at all sentimental,” said Elizabeth
with indignation. “Sentiment is so squashy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Mr. Atterton, quite unexpectedly.
“I’ve a sort of idea that—well,
that sentiment is the thing that makes it all seem
worth while, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if father begins to get sentimental, I’ve
done,” said Norah, laughing. “Come on, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the two young ladies followed Mrs. Atterton
and Mrs. Stamford through the open door,
and after a very brief interval the whole party
went into the ballroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The usual pianist provided for the class had
been supplemented by a violin, and the Lancers
were being danced in rather a frozen manner when
Mrs. Atterton entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted to see you,” she said to the village
schoolmaster, who also acted as dancing-master
and choir-master, teacher of singing and mender
of broken clocks—a person of such extraordinary
energy that no wonder he seemed to be made
of wire and India rubber, instead of the ordinary
materials, and had never found time to get married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pleasure is mutual,” said Mr. Willie
Kirke, bowing; he always prided himself on having
the right word ready. “I trust your—er—back
is fairly well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very kind. It is troubling me a little
this evening, owing to the sudden change of temperature,”
said Mrs. Atterton, who was always
gratified by any reference to the institution, and
would have talked about it with pleasure to a
crossing-sweeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb and Miss Fanny Kirke and Mrs.
Will Werrit sat in a corner and looked at Andy
as he came in with the Atterton girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe he has his eye on Miss Elizabeth,”
said Mrs. Jebb. “Of course this is in <span class='it'>strict</span> confidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! What makes you think so?” said the
other women eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I’ve a sort of second sight in
these matters,” replied Mrs. Jebb modestly, forbearing
to mention that she had held his blotter
to the looking-glass that morning. “Mr. Jebb
always used to say, ‘Emma detects an incipient
love-affair as a—as a——’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A weasel does a rat,” supplied Mrs. Will
Werrit obligingly. “Well, he seems a nice young
fellow enough, but the Attertons won’t want Miss
Elizabeth to marry a country parson, with all their
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know but what it isn’t nicer having
the class in the schoolroom,” said Miss Fanny
Kirke, who was thin, like her brother, and bright-eyed.
“They’re going through the grand-chain
now as if it were a funeral. And look at those
young men from Millsby, hunched in a corner
together like a lot of fowls with the pip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Norah Atterton, at the other end of the
room, whispered in substance the same thing to
her sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is awful!” she said. “I feel I made
a mistake in getting them to have the class here.
We shall have to make Dick Stamford and Bill
join in and start the country dances at once. Now
for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flew about in her gold and black gown like
some new sort of human wasp, and planted a little
sting here and there until she had the whole company
on the alert. Elizabeth talked first to one
girl and then another, her slow drawl with the
deep notes in it contrasting oddly with her sister’s
quick, clear accents. But there still hung about
the occasion that leaden dullness which can be
felt, but never described, and it was Mr. Atterton,
coming in breezily unconscious from an after-dinner
stroll, who saved the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then, Mr. Kirke,” he said, “I hear you
and my daughter are reviving the old country
dances for the ball on the lawn next week after
the bazaar. Excellent! Excellent! Rubbish
trying to waltz on a lawn. And I shouldn’t wonder
if your great-grandfather and mine stood up
at a dance on the green together a hundred years
ago. They were both neighbours here, anyway.
Really an excellent idea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It truly did seem a grand idea to him now that
he had adopted it, for that was his way. Everything
was splendid when it all belonged to him—even
an idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody must join in—everybody,” he
said. “Now, Mrs. Werrit, now Miss Kirke—no
skulking in corners. Mr. Thorpe, you stand
up with my daughter Elizabeth. My dear,” to
his wife, “you take Mr. Deane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never dance,” said Andy with dignified decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! Nonsense! My wife hasn’t
danced for years—Mr. Thorpe hasn’t either—they
both came as spectators.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shall not begin again now, my dear,”
laughed Mrs. Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma’s back!” said Elizabeth. “How
<span class='it'>can</span> you, father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the unexpected happened, as it always
does—Mrs. Atterton glanced at Andy, and the
spirit of mischief within her, which years and fat
had sent to sleep, flickered up for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” she chuckled; “if Mr. Deane will
dance, I will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” said Mr. Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” Andy was obliged to respond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the company were placed in two long lines by
the omniscient Mr. Kirke, and the leaden dullness
was lifting—lifting. With the first beginning
of the tune an old spirit of merry-making
that had been hiding in the bushes round Millsby
Common for fifty years or more crept forth,
heard the scraping of the fiddle, began to lose
the stiffness in his joints before he reached the
open windows, and was all a-caper, jocund, jovial,
glorious, by the time Mrs. Atterton had tripped
down the middle with the queer, surprising lightness
of fat people, crossed hands with Mr.
Thorpe, and returned panting and laughing to
her place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy was the next to go—clerical coat-tails
flying, curls rising in spite of half a bottle of brilliantine,
the Spirit of Ancient Revelry skipping
behind him, pricking his cheeks, whispering in
his ear, making him forget everything but that
life was most jolly, and he was off across a shining
space to clasp hands with Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Atterton chuckled, stamped to keep time
with the rest, perceived Mrs. Jebb drooping in a
corner, and led her triumphantly forth. It was a
sight that remained long in the memory of Millsby
parish, to see Mr. Atterton’s trim little figure
bobbing up and down gaily in his place, while his
grey hair hung in damp strands over his forehead,
and he responded to the “eye-cornering” of Mrs.
Jebb with reckless gallantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick Stamford had a tendency to put his arm
round any pretty girl that came his way, pleading
ignorance of the proper person and moment in a
country dance, and Mrs. Stamford jogged enduringly
forward to meet wiry little Mr. Will Werrit,
making the best of it because she was above
all things anxious to conciliate Mr. Atterton. She
would have jogged toward a charge of light cavalry
with the same stoic calmness if she could have
saved her son from any danger by so doing. But
the Spirit of Ancient Revelry never came near
her. He knew quite well that she thought him an
absolute and incomprehensible fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The schoolmaster hovered round, pulling,
pushing, commanding, advising—miraculously
at the bottom when he had been at the top a second
before—and at last he flung up his arms distractedly—“Ladies!
Ladies! You don’t want
to waddle, you want to willow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The musicians stopped; with the last wail of
the fiddle the Spirit of Ancient Revelry fled
through the window and, creeping ever more
slowly, lay down to sleep again in the bushes at
the edge of the green; people remembered that
they were enlightened products of the twentieth
century, with a superior education and a purpose
in life, and a chance to be as good as anybody if
they didn’t give themselves away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To willow—that’s a new verb! How clever
of Mr. Kirke, and how appropriate to the present
style of dress,” said Mrs. Atterton artificially,
putting up her eyeglass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had to do something to obliterate the fact
that her toupee was over one eye, and that she
had, for a quarter of an hour, totally forgotten
that she possessed a back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This kind of thing suits neither you nor me,
Mr. Deane,” said the churchwarden to Andy behind
his hand; “but, of course, we didn’t like to
disoblige Mr. Atterton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus was the dignity of the Church restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly sort of dance, I think,” remarked Rose
Werrit to Dick Stamford; “but, of course, they
had primitive ideas in those days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I liked it,” said Dick, who was more
lined about the mouth and heavier about the eyes
than a young man ought to be. “No stiffness
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not dancing <span class='it'>now,</span> Mr. Stamford,” giggled
Rose, moving her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I thought we were. I forget what I’m
doing when I’m with such a pretty girl as you,”
responded Dick, whose mode of compliment had
been learned in circles where, in such matters, you
dot your i’s and cross your t’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose frowned, but only as an offering to propriety,
and accompanied Dick in high feather to a
buffet where supper was already in progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Will Werrit, Mrs. Thorpe, and Mrs.
Jebb again foregathered round a little table and
criticised the refreshments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never was a cook yet who could make bread,”
said Mrs. Thorpe. “The inside of these sandwiches
is all right—but the bread——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a tang about the butter too,” said
Mrs. Will Werrit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talking of butter,” said Mrs. Jebb, rather
left out and anxious to make herself conversationally
felt, “it’s a queer thing—I’m telling you
in strictest confidence—that Mr. Deane never
touches it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t he?” said Mrs. Thorpe, astonished.
She paused, then added tentatively, “I suppose
he eats pretty well otherwise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not what I call a hearty eater,” said
Mrs. Jebb. “Now my poor husband——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eats no butter?” interjected Mrs. Will Werrit
with a side-glance at Andy as he stood by the
buffet. “You may depend on it he’s ruined his
digestion with eating too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” agreed Mrs. Thorpe, “I should never
have hinted at such a thing if it hadn’t leaked out
somehow without my knowledge, but of course <span class='it'>no</span>
stomach could stand the strain for any great
length of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their combined gaze, fixed on Andy’s slack
waistcoat, somehow drew his attention towards
the group, and he came forward, saying in his
most cheery, parochial manner—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mrs. Thorpe, can I get you anything
more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for us, thank you,” said Mrs. Thorpe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you are like me, not great supper-eaters,”
said Andy, anxious to be agreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glances passed round. Of course he could not
eat any supper. No doubt inordinate eating had
made him into a confirmed dyspeptic. No young
man in ordinary health would give up eating butter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at that moment a servant came quietly
through the crowd and spoke first to Mrs. Werrit
and then to Andy. Old Mrs. Werrit had been
taken suddenly worse and wished to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Will Werrit rose at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we give you a lift, Mr. Deane? We
were going in a few minutes, so it makes no matter.
Rose can come home with her cousins. My
sister-in-law, Mrs. Tom, has gone to the old lady
already. No one can say that it won’t be a happy
release.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed so strange—after the noise and bustle
and laughter—to sit in the back seat of the
Werrits’ cart and see the house and garden gradually
receding in the starlight. Every pulse was
thrilling still to the remembered touch of his arm
about Elizabeth—to the fragrance of her as she
rested for a second so near him—to the sweetness
of her eyes as she had glanced up at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Andy was in love, after the fashion which
is supposed to be dying out. However, so far,
the young lover still sees his lady infinitely fair:
and when that changes——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well—it is a pleasant thought—we shall be
somewhere else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so late that the June dawn was breaking
as Andy stood by the side of the old woman’s bed
in his dress clothes, his round face kind and grave
beneath his ruffled hair, his young voice most
clear and solemn in the still morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unto God’s gracious mercy and protection
we commit thee. The Lord bless thee and keep
thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The familiar word seemed to spread round the
old dying woman a precious atmosphere of love
and peace—to speed her forth on the long journey
with a certainty of joy and welcome at the
journey’s end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Margaret,” cried the old woman suddenly,
in quite a loud voice, “get up. It’s wash morning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great-aunt Margaret’s been dead fifty years,”
wept Mrs. Will Werrit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So death led Mrs. Werrit most tenderly—as
he does the very old—through the land of
youth to the land of Unknown Peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish,” said Mrs. Tom Werrit, bidding
Andy good-bye, “that I’d made her a plum-cake
yesterday. I knew she couldn’t eat it if I did,
but she seemed to want one such as they used
to have at Gaythorpe Feast when she was young.
I wish I’d made it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were very good to her,” was all Andy
found to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For he had often heard already, and had felt
once in his own heart, that terrible, hopeless cry
of the bereaved—“Come back and let us be
kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked home very gravely through the early
freshness of the morning, and the great things of
life—love, birth, death, and faith in God—began
to take their right places in his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been going to preach on the next Sunday
morning upon the Evidences of Immortality,
but he changed his mind upon that homeward
walk. He actually felt the subject was too big
for him.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Andy</span> did not feel inclined to go to bed when
he got home, and so had a bath and went to
work in the garden. He was not what you would
call a sentimental gardener, and only weeded the
herbaceous border because it was full of weeds,
and he had invited the Attertons and the Stamfords
to luncheon on the following day—so, of
course, he wished everything to be perfect before
it greeted the eyes of the Perfect Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after a while the windless freshness of the
early morning began to have its effect on his preoccupied
thoughts, and he felt a sort of cool spaciousness
in the little hot chambers of his mind,
as if all the doors had been thrown open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one knows how. The hot throbbing of
a thousand anxious thoughts, the gradual subsidence,
the sense of freshness and peace—but
only one person has been able to put it into words,
and that one is Thomas à Kempis: he no doubt
felt it one early morning, after having striven all
night long for cool light amid a hot darkness full
of fears.</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Quietness of heart and pleasant joy.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That’s it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy’s only <span class='it'>conscious</span> thought was that he
felt fresher now, and that he would take a few
vegetables up the lane to Mrs. Simpson. She had
nothing more than a little flower-garden before
her cottage, and would no doubt be glad of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he ate his breakfast with an appetite which
almost justified his early reputation in Gaythorpe,
and went off with a basket of green things, all wet
with dew, to his neighbour’s door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very kind,” said Mrs. Simpson. “I
never touch greens myself, but the children will
like them. It takes a green stomach to tackle
greens, I always think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced placidly from Andy to the two
children by the door, so evidently including him
among the green things of the earth that he felt
bound to assert himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is extremely bad for the health to take no
vegetables,” he remarked, with a flavour in his
voice compounded of the senior curate and the
lady lay helper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Mrs. Simpson, moving her calm
gaze from the distant fields, where it had strayed,
“well, my great-grandmother lived to be ninety-six,
and <span class='it'>she</span> never touched greens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy frowned. That was the way things happened
in real life—so different from a well-ordered
parish—no method anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you’ve made friends with Mrs.
Jebb,” he said, begging the question until he
thought of a good reply. “It’s rather lonely for
her, and I shall be grateful if you would look her
up sometimes—without your furniture polish,”
he added, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know Miss Elizabeth bid for the sideboard
to give me as well?” said Mrs. Simpson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Andy eagerly, so delighted to
speak of Elizabeth that he quite forgot to address
any further admonition on the subject of ‘greens.’
“Yes, it was a queer thing we should both
think of the same thing, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How lovely the ‘we’ sounded! Andy thrilled
to the exquisite, fresh music of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Simpson stroked Sally’s hair and said
calmly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that there was anything so
strange about it. All my life I’ve had things
happen like that. When I was a little girl like
Sally here I lost my best gloves—new ones they
were—and I went up into the china-cupboard by
myself and prayed hard to find them, and I did
find them under my bed—a place nobody would
think of finding new gloves in, would they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-no,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was the same thing,” continued Mrs.
Simpson, “with the cupboard. I prayed hard
about that sideboard, and I said if anything could
cheer me up a bit, it would, and I got it. I expect
Them that overlooks all thought I had had as
much as I could stand.” She paused, then added,
just in the same tone, “Sally, if that boy swallows
that carrot he’ll choke himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sally’s responsible little face sharpened, and she
ran out to rescue her charge from an untimely
end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naughty boy,” she said, taking the carrot
from his fat hand to substitute her own ripe gooseberry,
and she did it without any ill-feeling; he
was behaving, of course, as well as you could expect
boys to behave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as Andy tramped off with his empty basket,
an almost incredible idea crossed his mind. Could
Mrs. Simpson have reached a place beyond him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ridiculous! Her idea of the Deity as a sort of
Lost Property Office was an altogether wrong and
hideously material one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet——</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thought forced itself from somewhere outside
upon Andy’s mental vision. Had she not
perhaps grasped with the fingers of superstition
a corner of that gigantic truth which is above all
creeds—all theories—the truth that there is
no limit whatever to the power of faith?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy sat down to his study-table and wrote his
article for a paper to which he contributed at
those times—very rare times—when the editor
would accept his contributions. And after he had
been writing five minutes he felt perfectly certain,
of course, that he knew more about everything in
the world than Mrs. Simpson could ever possibly
do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still—there had been a moment——</p>

<p class='pindent'>About eleven o’clock he began to get restless
and to wonder at what hour a young lady would
be likely to visit the invalid parrot of a deceased
great-aunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so very early, because, after all, William
was not a lovable person in himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And not so very late, because of the great-aunt
deceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy washed his hands, put on a clean collar,
which is all a young person can do, be he never so
much in love, and strolled carelessly through the
garden to the back lane which led past the Petches’
cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pretended not to see Sam Petch as he went
by the asparagus bed, and hummed abstractedly
when he went out of the little corner gate. It was
as if he said to himself, “Ah, here is a gate—I
may as well go through it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he walked a step or two up the lane, then
viewed the garden hedge with an intent air, as if
he were laying deep plans about it. He even
pulled a leaf or two, critically, and so managed to
reach the holly bush at the end where there was
a stile deep in shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he paused, appearing to say to the blank
universe, “This is actually a stile. Stiles are
made to sit upon. I will sit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he waited for his girl to pass, by a sort of
logical sequence, which impressed the sparrows
very much, and quite allayed any undue curiosity
on the part of the fieldmice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sam Petch, being neither a sparrow nor a
fieldmouse, peeped through the holly bush and
wondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he saw Elizabeth coming along, and he
did not wonder any longer, but he did wish Andy
good luck, for he had a sort of generosity, had
young Sam Petch, and a sort that is rarer than it
seems—he could be glad that somebody else was
enjoying a treat while he had to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all the same he chuckled to himself at the
thought that Andy was going without butter, and
he had no scruples whatever about drinking all
he could afford to pay for, as usual; for he considered
that his master had interfered with the
most sacred right of a Briton—the right to get
drunk on beer—and that the punishment exquisitely
fitted the crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, he was growing fond of Andy, and he
gazed after him through the hole in the holly
bush with a benevolent eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gosh, I could put him up to a thing or two!
He doesn’t know how to begin. Squeeze ’er ’and,
squeeze ’er ’and, you young ijiot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he quite danced with impatience behind
the holly bush at the respectful brevity of his master’s
salute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the young couple went sedately down the
lane, and Sam Petch strolled back to his work,
remarking scornfully, “I could do better than
that when I was fifteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have been more scornful still if he
could have walked behind them, for Andy knew,
and Elizabeth knew, and both knew the other
knew, that this was not a chance meeting. It was,
for both of them, the first definite step upon that
journey which leads to the mysterious City of
Wedded Love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It lay before them, as it does before every
young lover—strange, wonderful, and yet with
familiar streets that we all know by name—an
enchanted muddle of realism and romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s going to rain,” remarked Andy,
but, of course, his heart said, “How sweet you
are—sweeter even than I thought!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Elizabeth replied—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the glass has gone down,” but, of course,
she really said, and Andy understood, “I’m glad
to be here with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then for a little while they walked along saying
nothing at all, because that had been so tremendous.
Only Andy’s young body worshipped
the exquisite harmony of his lady—cream gown,
skin of that peach-like shade that has no name,
golden eyes, and pure, burning sunlight in the
brown of her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his soul worshipped the kindness of her
voice and the clear candour of the girl’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, he was in love, body and soul, was Parson
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would never have believed that Norah was
really far the better looking of the two sisters,
with lovely features, graceful figure, and perfect
colouring, which left nothing for the imagination
of a lover to idealise, while Elizabeth’s charm
must always be, to a certain extent, in the eye of
the beholder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, old Sam Petch, in his little shanty
at the fag-end of the village, gave a description of
his friend Elizabeth, which was perhaps correct,
though not refined. “She’s just a niceish-looking
lass,” he said; “no beauty, though.” Then
he paused, pulled at his pipe, and winked at Andy,
who was his visitor. “Bud, howivver,” he added,
“she’s a cuddlesome one, she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy had replied with cold dignity at the time,
but he thought of it now, as he walked near Elizabeth—he
thought of it to the exclusion of all the
brilliant things he meant to have said to Her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here we are,” said he, opening the gate of
young Sam Petch’s garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, here we are,” echoed Elizabeth, who
really was rather an intelligent talker as a rule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the ‘we’ she echoed was the second step—the
enchanted muddle was that glorious
much nearer—and they could find no words in
face of such a view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How-do-you-do, Mrs. Petch?” said Elizabeth
at last; then she glanced round for the next
remark, quite forgetting what she had come for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how are your legs to-day, Mrs. Petch?”
said Andy, hiding his emotions under an expression
of overdone sympathy. Then he felt a lady’s
legs were perhaps not subjects to mention before
Elizabeth, and added with incoherent haste,
“But, of course, it’s heads the heat affects. Sunstroke.
Most dangerous thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Petch glanced at the poor ostrich trying to
stick <span class='it'>his</span> head in the sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My uncle had sunstroke,” she said, helping
to bury his wriggling extremities with a sort of
tolerant contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Deane and I have been talking about the
change in the weather ever since we met by accident
in the lane,” remarked Elizabeth, with a little
laugh. “It really is quite remarkable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed it is, miss. Fine to-day and dull to-morrow,
as you may say,” assented Mrs. Petch
cordially, casting a little sand over the other ostrich,
but asking herself scornfully what they took
her for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, Elizabeth remembered the purpose of
her visit, and looking round the room for an absent
bird-cage, she said hastily—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William’s not dead, is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, miss; William’s a lot better, only
he has to be kept quiet. Sam saw the bird-fancier
when he went into Bardswell on Saturday, and he
said perfect quiet was the thing. It just fell out
lucky, Mr. Deane giving Sam the afternoon off
to go and sell an old clock that the second-hand
dealer’s been wanting so long. Just right it did,
for it gave us a chance to get the best of advice
for William. It isn’t,” said Mrs. Petch, applying
the corner of her apron to her left eye, “it isn’t
only what we get with him that makes us so
anxious, but me and Sam has no bairns, and we’re
fair soft about him. We love him like a child,
that we do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might have been thought that Mrs. Petch
was talking on to ward off the question she saw
trembling on Elizabeth’s lips, but if so, she was
disappointed, for Elizabeth asked at once—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is William? I should like to look at
him. Mamma will not be satisfied if I go away
without seeing him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He stands on the dressing-table upstairs in
our bedroom window,” said Mrs. Petch. “That
looks out into the garden, and it’s just the place
for him, and he’s scattering seed all over everything;
but what do I care, poor lamb, so long as
he gets better? Let him only get himself again,
say I, and no matter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to see him,” said Elizabeth, with
a look which her family would have recognised.
Indeed, she possessed rather more than her share
of a quality which her friends called firmness, and
her family something else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really couldn’t take it upon myself with Sam
away——” began Mrs. Petch; then she glanced
at Elizabeth’s face, and added reluctantly,
“Of course, miss, if you accept the responsibility——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” said Elizabeth. “Shall I go up and
see the bird?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t done the room yet,” said Mrs.
Petch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’m afraid I shall have to ask you to
fetch him down,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Petch went slowly upstairs, creaking remonstrance
at every step, and Elizabeth whispered
to Andy—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m convinced that William is either dead or
dying, and Mrs. Petch is trying to hide it from
us. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lovely to have her appeal to him, even about
a bird with an unpleasant character. Andy
thrilled as he responded baldly, “Seems so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, contrary to all expectations, William appeared
to be in excellent health and feather; he
looked better, in fact, than he had done for a
long time. Elizabeth felt ashamed of having suspected
the poor woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William,” she murmured. “Poor old William!”
and held out a finger. “Is that tea
ready? Is that tea ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But William, for the first time since Elizabeth
had known him, failed to echo that familiar remark.
He refused to whistle, to draw corks, to
cry “Cat”—to do anything at all that he had
been in the habit of doing for the past twenty
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it!” said Mrs. Petch desperately. “I
daren’t tell you. I knew Mrs. Atterton would
think we’d been neglecting him, and we never
have. He’s lost his vocaberlery. He can only
make a hoarse shriek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw her apron over her head in a dramatic
attitude of despair, and in that moment the
parrot turned so that the light caught three yellow
feathers in his tail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, William never had a yellow feather before!”
exclaimed Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” muttered Mrs. Petch, still hidden in
her apron; “it’s the strong medicine the bird-fancier
sent as has done it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth’s glance met Andy’s rightfully indignant,
then both pairs of eyes began to twinkle,
and finally a tide of ridiculous, uncontrollable
laughter rose up within them. They felt it coming,
tried to keep it down, and were overcome by
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!” laughed Elizabeth, clear
as a bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!” laughed Andy in deeper
tones, but just as fresh and jolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put up her hand to wipe her eyes, when,
somehow, she caught her elbow on Andy’s stick
and hurt it. Andy instinctively touched her
arm, drew it tighter as they laughed together.
Then Mrs. Petch looked out from under her
apron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Er—Miss Atterton has hurt her arm,” stammered
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Petch’s shrewd little eyes were lowered
discreetly as she replied in a dejected manner—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to think it <span class='it'>funny</span>, miss, poor William
losing his voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it isn’t exactly—funny,” said Elizabeth,
very red and more breathless than a fit of
laughter should have left a gay young woman.
“It’s more—what you would call peculiar, isn’t
it, Mr. Deane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused, recovered her self-control with a
rapidity that astonished Andy, and added briskly,
“I must tell mamma about it; but no doubt his
vocabulary will come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt it,” said Mrs. Petch. “I doubt it
very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth walked to the door and said good-bye,
but at the last minute she turned back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Petch, I think William had better give
up taking the medicine that turns his tail yellow
before mamma sees him, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside, Norah and the pony-cart were already
in sight, so Andy only had time to murmur
hastily—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, you really ought to tell Mrs. Atterton;
it’s a shame to let yourself be done like——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” interrupted Elizabeth. “I am the
only person it really matters to, because the money
comes out of my pocket eventually. I inherit my
aunt’s fortune when I am twenty-five, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a question of money only,” began
Andy instructively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what is it?” laughed Elizabeth. But a
glance at his face showed her that something else
must be done, and she put her hand lightly on his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s keep it a secret,” she said—“<span class='it'>do</span>.”—Oh,
Elizabeth!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you really think——” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Norah clattered up with the little cart,
and Elizabeth got in.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was the day of the luncheon-party at the Vicarage,
and the Vicar sat in solemn conclave with
his lady-cook-housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you really think boilers?” he said
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ordered boilers, so they’ll have to be,” said
Mrs. Jebb, with the air of a person rather at the
end of her tether. “We agreed that with white
sauce and grated egg and lemon slices you could
make boiled fowls look more dressy than plain
roast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, of course,” said Andy hastily,
wishing to keep her in a good temper until the
great day was over. “Stupid of me to have forgotten
that. And the asparagus”—he hardly
dared it, but he did—“I suppose you’re quite
accustomed to cooking asparagus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any one can cook asparagus,” said Mrs. Jebb
coldly. “I haven’t cooked it, because we never
had it when I was a girl at home, and Mr. Jebb
didn’t like it. But it’s boiled with plain water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>And</span> melted butter served with it,” suggested
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Mrs. Jebb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we’d better not have any waiting,”
continued Andy. “Sophy” (Sophy was the
small maid) “will hardly be up to it, eh? And is
there anything else that you can think of, Mrs.
Jebb? Being a lady yourself, you will understand——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb thawed a little and considered dramatically,
with her finger to her brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s see. What did we do when we entertained
at ‘The Laurels’ in Mr. Jebb’s lifetime?
Scented soap. Clean towels. Black and white
pins. Ah, there’s one thing I have forgotten—if
you really wish to provide all—but in a
bachelor’s household they would never——” She
paused tantalisingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” demanded Andy. “Anything
I can——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps it’s hardly a subject to mention
to an unmarried gentleman,” hesitated Mrs. Jebb;
“but if you want everything to be complete you
ought to provide face powder. It’s always done.
Ladies come in warm, or flustered, or shiny about
the nose, and a dash of powder means everything
to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s none to be bought in Gaythorpe,”
said Andy, cast down at the omission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there is. Go to the grocer’s and ask for
a box of violet powder the same as he keeps for
babies. That’ll do quite well,” said Mrs. Jebb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, neither Sophy nor I have time to go,”
said Mrs. Jebb, “and it doesn’t really matter
at——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it’s the right thing to have I’ll go and fetch
it,” interposed Andy desperately, which shows
once more what any man—even a new vicar, who
thinks he knows nearly everything—will do for
the Beloved before he gets her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was disappointing that the Atterton girls did
not enter the guest-chamber prepared for them
with such care, after all, but laid their sunshades
and dust-coats down in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure you wouldn’t like to wash your
hands?” urged Andy, thinking of the black and
white pins, scented soap, and violet powder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine are quite clean. I don’t know about
Elizabeth’s,” said Norah, with her little smile,
marching into the dining-room, followed by her
brother Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma was so sorry not to be able to come
at the last minute,” apologised Elizabeth. “But
she is not very well to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She took the schoolmaster’s words to heart
the night of the dancing class and ‘wanted to
willow,’ ” said Norah. “At least she wanted to
willow more than she did. So she started some
sort of treatment—hot water—strict diet—and it
has upset her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t the treatment that upset the mater,”
said Bill, with a grin; “it was the way she broke
loose last night to make up for a week of fasting.
I watched her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was how they talked about their mother,
and yet it was strikingly evident in every word
they spoke how they loved her and one another.
An atmosphere of invincible family affection surrounded
the Attertons like a glow of firelight—as
if they were always gathered in spirit round a
cheerful hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father’s in Marshaven, gloating over a
new row of red-brick houses,” said Norah. “But
you knew he couldn’t come? He has a magistrates’
meeting at Bardswell to-day as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, here are Mrs. Stamford and Dick,” said
Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Voices were heard from the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you,” in Mrs. Stamford’s croaky,
distinct voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb in a vague, persuasive undertone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear woman, I can’t and won’t wash
my hands again. Do you think they’re as dirty
as my gloves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, as the Squire’s wife came forward to
greet her host, it could be plainly seen that her
wash-leather gloves had known long and faithful
service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your housekeeper nearly pushed me up the
stairs,” she said indignantly to Andy. “What’s
she mean by it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Deane seemed rather anxious <span class='it'>we</span>
should wash our hands,” laughed Norah, coming
carelessly to Andy’s assistance. “I know what
it is. The Vicarage is sacred, and you wash your
hands when you enter in the same way as you
take off your shoes at the door of a mosque.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The—the fact is,” said Andy, “Mrs. Jebb
has made everything as smart as she could upstairs,
and I expect she wanted you to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, poor thing! I say, Mrs. Stamford, let
us go after all. She’ll be so disappointed,” said
Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come too, if you like,” suggested Dick,
whose conception of wit was rather elemental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be foolish, Dick,” said his mother, who
actually enjoyed his jokes because they showed
his frequent moods of sullen discontent had lifted
for the time being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they all went out and returned in
five minutes, Norah’s nose being conspicuously
white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see we’ve used <span class='it'>all</span> the luxuries you provided,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy gave an involuntary chuckle, for the
coating of coarse, white violet powder had such
an odd effect on her little nose, contrasted with
her delicate face. Then all the others began
to laugh too—Mrs. Stamford because the rest
did, and she wished to be a sort of jolly-good-fellow
with her son’s friends. It was really almost
grotesque to see this woman run counter to
every instinct but that of mother-love in order
to please her boy—at least it would have been
grotesque if it had not been almost tragic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a violent irritation was produced in her by
the effort, all the same, and she turned sharply
to Bill Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you start work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In October. At least I’m supposed to be
reading with old Banks and Bardswell now, but I
go up to Cambridge in October.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum,” said Mrs. Stamford. “Well, it’s
time you did. You are getting too stout. Face
of fourteen and figure of forty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Atterton girls laughed and took it all in
good part—they were so used to shafts of that
kind flying about the family—but it hit Bill on
his most tender spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can return the compliment,” he said, with a
pleasant smile. “Now, you have the figure of
sixteen and the face of sixty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all involuntarily glanced at Mrs. Stamford’s
spare, angular form and weather-beaten
face, and found it too true to trifle with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nonsense,” said Norah, with a lightning
glance at Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha-ha! I call it rather good,” laughed
Dick Stamford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stamford laughed too, with him; but
something pulled tight inside of her. So that
was how she looked to her son!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they all began to cast surreptitious glances
at the clock, and Andy saw that it was already
ten minutes past two, though the guests had been
invited for one-thirty. The anxious host began to
fidget about the room and give distracted replies,
and the conversation grew more desultory than
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is Mrs. Simpson’s sideboard,” said
Norah. “How dreadful in this room! And
how weak of you! Don’t you hate it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy caught sight of Elizabeth’s averted face
and for a moment forgot all about the lateness of
the luncheon. She was thinking the same thing
as he was thinking. Glorious moment!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Don’t</span> you hate it?” repeated Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I—er—sort of like it now,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a faint colour crept up the bloomy cream
of Elizabeth’s cheek to her ear, and Andy could
not help trying to make her turn towards him with
a futile, “What do you think of it, Miss Elizabeth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s hideous! But there’s something I
rather like about it too,” said Miss Elizabeth
demurely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the little maid appeared in the doorway
with an expression which would have made the
most obtuse hostess on earth remember that she
had forgotten her handkerchief and go hastily in
search of it. But Andy, being a man, only glared
vacantly at her and wondered what she wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She whispered a ‘Sir’ so hoarse with nervousness
that no one could hear it, and then in despair
she beckoned with her forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” suggested Elizabeth apologetically,
“that your maid——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? Luncheon ready? Then bring
it in,” commanded Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the child shook her head hopelessly and
tears appeared in her goggling blue eyes. A
sound as of wood crackling and a range roaring,
with all dampers out, came through the open door
behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked Andy again, with some
impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said I was to tell in private, but you won’t
<span class='it'>be</span> private,” burst forth the maid, half crying
and finding her voice at last “The asparagus
won’t cook. We’ve been feeding the fire since
twelve with all the firewood there is, and the soft
end is boiled to a mush, but the hard end’s as
hard as ever it was. You’ll have to do without
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she flung up her apron and clattered back
to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s really most——” began Andy, pale with
annoyance, striding towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bill caught hold of a flying coat-tail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easy on,” he said. “She couldn’t help
it. She’s done”—he paused, then burst out
into an irresistible guffaw—“she’s done her
best!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very kind of you to make a joke——”
began Andy again, when Norah remarked—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Make</span> a joke! You couldn’t <span class='it'>make</span> a joke like
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the whole party, excepting Mrs. Stamford,
laughed with such infectious gaiety that the
agitated host at last joined in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the little maid now reappeared
bearing the chickens, which were so elegant in
their white sauce and golden egg and green
parsley that Andy felt comforted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing I like so much as a boiled chicken,”
said Elizabeth, assuming an air of greedy expectation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always maintain,” said Bill, “that if you
ask the King to lunch and give him a fowl, he’s
all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect that’s what you gave him, last time
he lunched with you, eh?” chaffed Dick Stamford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy took no part in the conversation. He
was too much engaged in carving, and being at
no time an expert, he failed to find the joints
of the fowls and cut slices from various parts.
It required a silent concentration of mind and
muscle to sever the legs, of which in cooler moments
he would have been incapable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, however, everybody was served, and
he sat down, bathed in perspiration, to talk about
the weather. He had already done so twice
over, but he could think of nothing else. He
forgot to give himself any chicken, and ate potatoes
agitatedly with a knife and fork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One wonders if this weather can possibly
last,” he said, unconsciously grasping at the manner
of the senior curate in his emergency. “It
will be a providence for the farmers if it continues
to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice slackened—stopped. He glanced
from one guest to the other. No one had even
touched their chicken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Stamford, as it were, stepped forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re so very sorry. No doubt your cook,
being from the town, is accustomed to have the
fowls ready prepared.” She paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got these from Mrs. Werrit. Usually we
have them from Mrs. Thorpe,” said Andy hopelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In summer,” continued Mrs. Stamford, “it
is usual about here to send the poultry home not
drawn—it keeps better so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not drawn,” echoed Andy vaguely, all at sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Bill took hold of the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old girl’s boiled ’em with their insides
in,” he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought,” said Andy, staring wide-eyed
from one to the other, “that there was <span class='it'>something</span>
funny. But I never dreamed of anything as bad
as this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Jebb’ll die. She’s so refined,” said Dick
Stamford, trying to turn the thoughts of his host
from his own despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She deserves to die,” said Andy with extreme
bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Beloved for the first time under his roof—and
he had offered her this! If he had been a
woman he would have wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Mrs. Jebb! She decorated them so
beautifully. She tried so hard,” murmured Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must say I’m sorry for the woman. It will
never be forgotten in Gaythorpe so long as
Gaythorpe exists,” said Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” said Bill. “It is rough on the
poor old thing. She’s tried her best. Let’s bury
the bits in the garden, and she’ll think we’ve eaten
them, and we’ll say nothing about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ridiculous!” said Mrs. Stamford. “Personally
I like bread and cheese for lunch better than
anything, so I am going to help myself from that
Gorgonzola on the sideboard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the idea of burying the lunch in the garden
struck the Atterton family as novel and delightful.
And when they were in certain moods there
was no withstanding them; so a procession headed
by Mrs. Stamford and closed by Andy, each
person bearing a plate, actually did creep with
caution through the French window of the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A spade,” whispered Bill, to whom the
whole thing had already become a thrilling adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s one,” replied Andy in the same tone;
he was gradually warming to the spirit of it all
and forgetting his despair. “That’s a good
place under the gooseberry bushes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have some juicy ones next year,” suggested
Dick Stamford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Norah. “We must do the thing
in proper style. Mrs. Stamford—you first. Mr.
Deane—you didn’t take any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wise chap. Knew better,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy lifted an anxious face from the hole under
the gooseberry bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You surely don’t think——” he began,
aghast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish. Of course not. Here, Elizabeth,
pop in your lot,” said Norah briskly, but in a
guarded tone, and with an eye on the windows
of the house. “Give me the spade. I’ll pat
him down. Now, let’s creep back to the house.
Oh, isn’t it lovely? Don’t you feel as if you had
murdered somebody and just been burying the
body?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down again before empty plates, and
Andy, half amused and half rueful, paused with
a hand on the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I ring now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes. We’re all ready,” said the young
people excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the little maid came in and began to remove
the plates in her usual clattering style. But when
she had gathered four in a heap on her tray, her
blue eyes began to goggle again, and by the time
she had amassed the lot they seemed ready to
fall out of her head with some incomprehensible
emotion; or a mixture of emotions. For horror,
surprise, and admiration were all mingled in the
final goggle which she cast upon the party as she
retired from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an incredibly brief space of time, considering
she had to put on a clean apron, Mrs. Jebb appeared
bearing a dish of stewed raspberries and
cream. The little maid followed close behind
her, as if for protection, and they both now wore
the queer mingled expression, complicated, in
Mrs. Jebb’s case, by the most acute and lively
curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had sworn never to wait, and held any
form of “waiting” to be beneath the dignity of
a lady-cook-housekeeper, but curiosity is a passion
stronger than pride, and she glanced hastily round
the room, searching the sideboard, the side-table,
the window-seat, even the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then an imperceptible nod passed between her
and the little maid—but it expressed columns of
close newspaper print—and they retired backwards
together, both now goggling alike upon
the company and closing the door with an odd
reluctance, as if they shut in some fascinating horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guests feigned to be unconscious of this
singular behaviour, though Mrs. Stamford really
began to feel as if she were having lunch in a
nightmare, and it was Andy himself who spluttered
out, purple with suppressed laughter—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They think we’ve eaten the b-bones!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>what</span>?” cried Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a light kindled from one face to the other
until they all sat in a blaze of hilarious comprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young laughter pealed out through the
open windows, and across the garden as far as
the quiet place where old Gulielmus lay asleep—but
it made no discordance there, because it only
sang in the long grass above his head, the jolly
creed of his lifetime: “Laugh when you can,
and cry when you can’t, and trust God to make
all right at the finish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know why I’m going on like this,” said
Norah, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s never the funny things that do split your
sides,” said Bill. “It’s always something just
idiotic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That little maid of yours thought we were
going to crunch <span class='it'>her</span> bones next,” gasped Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they all started again. Again the young
laughter pealed out over the quiet graves, saying
“Life’s a jolly thing!” and there was, in that
moment, an atmosphere in the room which seemed
made up of beauty and hope and simple merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oddly enough, Andy himself suddenly thought
of the grave beyond the yew hedge. It was almost
as if Gulielmus had answered back that message
of laughter with a splendid, “And death’s also
jolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, of course, all this passed sub-consciously
through Andy’s mind, and the only definite
thought that reached him was embodied in his
casual—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was another bachelor vicar here in
1687. A man called Will Ford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if he gave luncheon parties,”
laughed Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’d give anything that was going, would
Will Ford,” said Andy, smiling back at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, oddly enough, he felt as if he were talking
of his friend to the woman he loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had a splendid lunch,” said Mrs. Stamford,
rising. “Haven’t eaten so much for
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d no idea bread and butter and cheese
were so delicious,” said Elizabeth. “It shows
we always eat them at the wrong end of a
meal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never enjoyed a luncheon-party so much in
my life,” said Bill. “Hate ’em as a rule,” he
added, rather dimming the compliment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great sport,” condescended Dick Stamford,
helping Elizabeth on with her coat. He did not
talk much to her, but he was usually somewhere
near her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stood, looking from one to the other,
half proud and half dubious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad—if you really did—awfully good of
you to be so kind about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said Norah, “we shall have a
most delightfully ghoulish reputation in Gaythorpe
village. The bone-eaters—to be seen almost
any day free of charge—ladies and gentlemen—please
walk up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall inform Mrs. Jebb,” began Andy
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you do, I’ll never speak to you again—nor
Elizabeth either,” she added, with something far
too delicate to be called a wink—and yet—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy blushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—if you’d rather not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he remembered he had said that to Elizabeth
about the parrot secret, and blushed still
more deeply, and could have kicked himself for
blushing at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah’s lips curled in that odd little smile of
hers that did not show her teeth, and her eyes
twinkled maliciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be greatly annoyed, and I’m sure
you wouldn’t annoy me for the world, would you,
Mr. Deane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-no,” said Andy, puzzled what on earth
she was driving at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if he had been behind the two sisters as
they walked up the drive to their own house that
evening he might have felt enlightened—or he
might not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was fun at Gaythorpe Vicarage, wasn’t
it?” said Norah blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Elizabeth. “Are you going to
Bardswell to-morrow or——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth!” interrupted Norah. “Surely
you’re not going to be so silly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” responded Norah, “that you’d better
remember life at a country vicarage isn’t all
laughing at nothing and burying boiled fowl under
a gooseberry bush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought it was,” said Elizabeth somewhat
shortly. “Oh, here’s father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she greeted her parent with quite unusual
effusion.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Andy</span> paid one or two calls in the parish that
afternoon and then went into the church to ring
the bell for evensong. Clang, clang, cling! Come
to church! So it had rung for generations of
Sundays across the quiet fields, but only for Andy
had it worked upon a week-day. He had a great
argument on the subject with Mr. Thorpe, who
thought that week-day services in Gaythorpe,
where every one was busy from morning to night,
would be merely an accentuation of the fact that
the parson had nothing to do. For Gaythorpe
never could and never would believe that a parson’s
occupations could be truthfully called work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only when Andy did finally so envelop
himself in the mantle of the senior curate as to
leave not a trace of the original Andy to be seen,
that Mr. Thorpe said, “Have two a day, then,
if you like. But to my mind it’s ridiculous!
And nobody’ll come unless they want to get something
out of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody, evidently, thought what could be got
out of Andy worth leaving work and attending
daily service for, so he read the service grimly
alone each morning and late afternoon. Labourers,
looking up from their work, used to say
in a morning with a chuckle, “Parson’s at it
again. Pity he hasn’t nowt better to do.” And
later in the day, women, straining the milk, would
remark to one another, “Does he think we’re
going to leave all this and go up to church just
at tea-time? Here—are them eggs for Mr.
Deane? Oh, he only gets twelve to the shilling.
It’s grocer gets thirteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy rang a quiet one—two—three, one—two—three,
through the golden light of a late
June afternoon, and afterwards stood alone as
usual to read the lovely words of prayer and
praise which seem to have been written in an age
when men could be poets and yet sincere. An atmosphere
of simple goodness and humanity clings
like incense about the evening service, and the
close of it is—in the dullest, dreariest place—like
evening light through a stained window. It leaves
such an impression of solemn peace and beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy forgot to be annoyed at the absence of
a congregation before he reached the exquisite
prayer about the perils and dangers of this night,
and he walked home quite content. He was not,
of course, a model clergyman, or perhaps he
would have gone on worrying about the absent
flock. And when he got in he found Mr. Thorpe
waiting for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Waste of time,” said Mr. Thorpe. “Waste
of time! What good does it do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was a poser! What good <span class='it'>did</span> it do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stops me from getting slack,” said Andy, at
last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you!” Mr. Thorpe implied that Andy
ought to be able to look after his own eternal
welfare without any outside help—it was his business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And perhaps when people hear the bell going
it reminds them of good thoughts,” suggested
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if they’re chapel?” said Mr. Thorpe.
“There’s more chapel than church in Gaythorpe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy ceased arguing and called up the senior
curate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do what I think right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well! Nobody can do more than
that,” admitted Mr. Thorpe, and he glanced
slowly round the room for a change of subject.
“I see you have the sideboard still. Looks well
there. Handsome bit o’ furniture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you made a mistake, buying it in. You
oughtn’t to have bought it in. If us Thorpes
had thought Mrs. Simpson required that sideboard,
us Thorpes would have bought it in for
her. You meant well. But you made a mistake.
Us Thorpes would have bought it in ourselves if
it had been required.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He straightened his chest as one who has delivered
himself of a burden, and added—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not one to bear grudges and tattle from
one to another. If I have anything to say to a
man I say it to <span class='it'>him</span>. Us Thorpes are like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Thorpe. I’m afraid I did
seem officious. I didn’t mean to be,” said Andy,
with a manly simplicity and an understanding of
the point of view of “us Thorpes” which was
very pleasant and was all Andy—not a vestige of
the senior curate in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally,” continued Mr. Thorpe in a tone
that somehow responded to Andy’s, but in words
which he had previously rehearsed to Mrs.
Thorpe and did not intend to depart from—“Naturally
it was narking to a well-known family like
us Thorpes, with big farms all around Bardswell,
to have the tale going about. If we’d
thought she required the sideboard bought in, we
should have bought it in. We knew she didn’t
require it, so we didn’t buy it. But,” he added,
unrehearsed, “all’s well that ends well, and so
it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway I promise not to buy any more sideboards,”
said Andy with a rueful smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thorpe relaxed altogether, and his black
eyes began to twinkle in his fat red face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She run you up, I hear. You had to pay a
matter of eight pounds odd more than you would
have done if Miss Elizabeth hadn’t been there.
Appears Mrs. Simpson had been complaining to
both of you, and you neither of you knew the
other was going to give it to her. Would have
been a rare good joke under some circumstances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Mr. Thorpe really meant was that it
would have been a rare good joke if it had happened
in the Werrit family—but he did not say
so, even to himself. He added, instead—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Handsome young lady, Miss Elizabeth.
Though most people admire Miss Norah most.
But she’s one of your clever ones—you don’t
want a wife too clever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people don’t want a wife at all,” said
Andy, with self-conscious jocularity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s neither you nor me, Mr. Deane,”
said Mr. Thorpe with a fat wink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy drew himself up and toyed with the
paperknife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the school-treat?” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—that’s what I came about,” said Mr.
Thorpe, responding to the check. “It appears
that you’ve consulted Miss Fanny Kirke about
the date.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Andy. “I expected she would
know all the details.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody knows them,” said Mr. Thorpe.
“They’re always the same. But you ought to
have gone to some responsible lady like Mrs.
Thorpe or Mrs. Will Werrit. I, myself, make
nothing of being churchwarden. But Mrs.
Thorpe seems to think that, in the position of
churchwarden’s wife, she ought to have been
asked to fix the date. Or Mrs. Tom Werrit. Or
Mrs. Will.” He rose. “I was to tell you they
can’t take trays this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not take trays!” said Andy, who had already
learned what that involved. “Why, they
used to make themselves responsible for nearly
all the provisions required. What shall we
do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. They said I was to let you
know, and I’ve <span class='it'>let</span> you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was evident he had acted under compulsion,
and he added, as one man to another—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go and have it out with ’em. Butter ’em
up a bit and they’ll come round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Andy replied—as one man to another—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m hanged if I will! I’ll manage somehow
if I have to make the cakes myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thorpe nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you like, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, oddly enough, his respect for Andy was
increased by this unreasonable behaviour, and
he stood by the door, scratching his head, and
slowly evolving a means of compromise. Then
he closed the door again, advanced a few steps,
and remarked with the air of a conspirator, “I’ve
got it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His manner was so queerly at variance with
his appearance, that any one not concerned in
the serious question must have been tickled by
the incongruity; but Andy peered at him anxiously—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I’ll</span> fix the date. Can’t let you have my
waggons to take the children until the 12th.
You’d said the 5th. And if the date’s altered to
suit me, Mrs. Thorpe must oblige you. And
Mrs. Will and Mrs. Tom Werrit’ll follow
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Mr. Thorpe’s first effort at diplomacy,
and he was fifty-one. No wonder he glowed
with the late joy of the creator and forgot everything
but the splendour of his own idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My word. That’s a splendid plan. Awfully
good of you,” said Andy with eager sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not a word to Mrs. Thorpe. Not a
word,” chuckled Mr. Thorpe, going towards the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may rely on me,” said Andy warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thorpe paused with his hand on the door
before opening it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he said. “You can’t know as
much about women as I do. You come to <span class='it'>me</span> if
you get stuck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He really felt, now he had started on a diplomatist’s
career, that he should like to go on. He
felt all the stirring pleasure of using talents
hitherto unsuspected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” said Andy gratefully, though he did
think it rather ridiculous that fat Mr. Thorpe
should consider he knew more about women than
a young man who had been a curate in London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a pack of women in Gaythorpe,” said
Mr. Thorpe, opening the door. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that was not what he meant to say, nor
what Andy understood. He intended to convey
to his Vicar the strange comradeship which binds
all men together against all women. And the
hand-shake they exchanged was a final expression
of this bond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it is ridiculous to pretend that spoken
words are so tremendously important, and that
they alone bridge the blank space between one
soul and another; they cast a line, as it were, but
souls cross always in silence. The intrinsic part
of every conversation is without words, which, if
you think of it, becomes very comforting. It
shows that our souls are not so lonely as we
feared, and that they have a language which even
death need not cause us to forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy went back to his study full of the
things that Mr. Thorpe had never said, and the
churchwarden plodded sedately down the road
mentally patting his Vicar on the back for remarks
he had never made; and they both felt
pleased with themselves, and each other—which
is not a bad result for any conversation to have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy pulled out a few sheets of foolscap, and
began to write one of those articles which were
sometimes accepted, when Mrs. Jebb came in to
apologise about the asparagus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” she said with mournful dignity,
“but it is my misfortune and not my fault that
my youth was not passed in circles where asparagus
can be afforded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said Andy. “I’m sure they
enjoyed the party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb pursed her lips together and approached
mysteriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing,” she said in a low voice, “strikes
me as very strange. The bones!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What bones?” said Andy, bending over the
foolscap. “I’m rather busy just now, Mrs. Jebb,
so if——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I and Sophy have searched the dining-room.
Then a cat occurred to our minds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The poor old cat looked hungry,” said the
Vicar after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I <span class='it'>thought</span> you must have given them to
the cat,” said Mrs. Jebb. “But at a luncheon
party—however, in a bachelor’s establishment——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She evidently felt that Andy had not known
how to behave, and that made the next step
easier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear,” she continued, “that Mrs. Thorpe
is to blame for what might have been a catastrophe
if the fowls had been—er—entirely dismembered.
I forget if it is larks, or a woodcock,
or what, that you do cook in that way,
though I never thought it really <span class='it'>nice</span>. However,
as everything went off all right——” She
paused for Andy’s reply, having put the matter,
it must be confessed, with some delicacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, excellently,” said Andy. “You must
have heard us laughing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. If there had been champagne—but
there wasn’t——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the point of a conversation passed unspoken,
and then Andy pulled his paper towards
him with such determination that Mrs. Jebb fluttered
from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes later she tripped back, bearing a
vase of roses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always think a man’s room looks so desolate
without flowers. As if he had no woman to
care for him,” and she placed the vase close to
Andy’s elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thanked her briefly without looking up.
But when she had gone out again he stared
blankly at the print on the opposite wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blest if the old girl isn’t gone on me! How
unpleasant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attentions of certain elderly-young church
workers in his late parish had paved the way
for comprehension, and he comprehended. But
though it was intensely annoying he did not feel
it to be unnatural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was, of course, an attractive fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That he had learned, too, in his late curacy,
for before that he had been exceedingly doubtful
of his own charms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went in to supper feeling annoyed with
Mrs. Jebb, but rather sorry for her all the same.
And after supper he strolled out into the garden,
where twilight was falling and the young moon
was rising above a bank of cloud. A feeling of
loneliness drove him to the front gate, where he
could watch the distant houses being lighted up,
one after the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Homes—thought Andy. Places where people
were trying—trying——</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not get hold of the tail of the flying
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then an oldish man passed, worn with long
labour, most patient in the twilight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought came near again, but not near
enough, and Andy called out a friendly ‘Good-night.’
Then he added impulsively, because he
somehow wanted to do something—he somehow
felt ashamed before that plodding figure—“I
say, will you have a cigar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stopped, stared, and replied bluntly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never smoked a cigar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then take these,” said Andy, emptying his
case of that portion of his aunt’s last Christmas
present with which he had stocked it in anticipation
of the luncheon-party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir,” said the man, stuffing them
into his bag with a bit of bread and half an
onion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he plodded on again, thinking the Vicar
was a rum ’un, and no mistake, and agreeing
with the newspaper he took that parsons ought
to be done away with if they could afford to go
about with their pockets crammed with cigars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stood there, looking after the man as he
went up the lane to the little house where he
slept at night, and where he had kept his wife, and
maintained his children ever since early youth.
He smelt of earth and sweat and was rough in
his manner, and yet he enabled the Vicar of Gaythorpe
to get hold of that thought which had
previously eluded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is pleasant to see the glory in things that are
glorious, but there is a still more intimate and
exquisite pleasure about seeing glory in things
which seem sordid. It is a sort of treasure-hunting
of the soul—as fresh and full of life as a
boy’s treasure-hunt in a water-logged hulk—as
full of the thrillingly unexpected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy went back into the study and took down
some accounts which he had shelved. They dated
from the late Vicar’s time, and were complicated,
and he stuck to them until they were done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had no idea why he did it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he put down his pen and stretched himself,
and something he had vaguely been keeping
at bay ever since the early afternoon swept over
him like a tide. He lit a candle and went out into
the silent hall where the light was already extinguished,
and unlocked the dining-room door.
It had the odd look common to all unused rooms
at night—they seem to be waiting in some uncanny
and yet quite conscious way for somebody
long gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy came there to search for nearer dreams
of Elizabeth. Elizabeth as she had been in her
youth and gracious kindness only a few hours
before. Elizabeth as she might be when they were
married. And he found instead the most clear
and vivid memory of a man he had never seen.
He never thought much of the old Vicar, for what
he had heard of him in no way appealed to the
imagination. And yet now he suddenly remembered
the years his predecessor had spent between
these walls, and that he must, too, have been
young when he came—young and full of life and
hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, truly, as if the old Vicar held out a
hand in that still, dimly-lighted room, claiming
recognition, and the new Vicar gave it in a half-spoken—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old chap! I’d forgotten he planted the
rose trees and the holly hedge. He must have
liked the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Andy went to bed, but he was restless and
could not sleep, for now the dreams of Elizabeth
that he went to look for in the dining-room
pressed so close around him that he remained
vividly awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not have told next morning what
those confused dreams were—no one, not even a
young man can describe the dreams of a young
man about the girl he hopes to marry. They are
like the City of Married Love itself, that has
spires soaring into a clear heaven and little dim
places where a man may hide. And one tells of
the spires and another of the dark, but no one of
the whole; for the poet and realist and true lover
all combined who can write about those dreams
as they are, has yet to be born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And married love—that Enchanted Muddle—is
different from any other love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For love without marriage has also the dark
places and the spires pointing upwards, but it has
no battlements—and battlements keep in and
keep out many things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy got up in the morning, hoping to see
Elizabeth, and yet almost afraid to see her, lest
she should guess that he had dared to come so
near to her in his dreams.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A letter lay on the breakfast-table that seemed,
even when opened and read, to be of minor importance.
But that is the extraordinarily interesting
thing about life—you never can tell what is
important and what is not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, of course, “<span class='sc'>Dear Andy.</span>—We are coming
to Marshaven for a few days on the 15th.
Promenade Hotel. Do come over and see us.—Your
affectionate Aunt,” could hardly—any more
than the sideboard—be regarded as a likely messenger
of Fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy beamed as he helped himself to fried bacon.
Fortunate—most fortunate. Just when he
needed some one to back him up in demanding the
hand of a girl who might marry a duke if she
wanted, here was the fashionable Aunt Dixon
with her two stylish daughters by a husband previous
to Uncle Dixon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gratitude which Andy had always felt to
his aunt by marriage for her kindness to him, and
the admiration he had always entertained for the
Webster girls, grew stronger than ever as he
sat eating his breakfast; then his reflections
were interrupted by the incursion of Mrs.
Jebb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me interrupting,” she said, “but an
extraordinary thing’s happened. The cat buried
the bones under a gooseberry bush, and Sam
Petch found them. I’ve never heard of a cat doing
that before. You ought to write to some paper
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most odd,” said Andy, rising—Andy, who
had always seen so clearly that straight line between
truth and fiction. “By the way, I want to
speak to Sam about something.” And he hastily
escaped across the lawn to the rose-garden, where
he found Sam engaged in doing something mysterious
with two old umbrellas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sheltering some fine blooms that’s coming
out, sir,” replied Sam. “I thought you’d
maybe like ’em sheltered. They’ll be ready to
cut by to-morrow. Fit for a queen they’ll
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rayther fancied you might want ’em, sir,”
said Sam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The grass in front of the study window requires
cutting,” said Andy. “I should like it to
be done at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir—certainly, sir,” said Sam, with deep
respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there passed between the two men an unspoken
conversation, thrilling and full of point,
which left Andy greatly annoyed. How had a
fellow like that learned a secret that he had told
to no one in the world?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It enraged him to think that Sam Petch should
know he loved Elizabeth before he had told even
her. Mrs. Petch’s apron could not have been so
opaque as it appeared during that exquisite moment
when he held Elizabeth’s arm in the cottage
kitchen and they laughed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the memory of that moment thrilled
him to a bravery that made him care naught for
fifty Sam Petches. He returned to the rose-garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can keep those roses sheltered. I may
want them, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said Sam solemnly, without looking
up. “I’ll see to it, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when his Vicar had passed out of sight he
straightened his long figure and looked towards
the house with a queer mixture of scorn and affection
on his handsome face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why doesn’t he ask me how to go on? I
could let him have a tip or two. There isn’t
enough of the ‘Give us a kiss, me lass, first, and
talk after,’ about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Sam Petch smiled pleasantly as he
moved to another rose bush—a vista of happy
occasions not neglected rose before his mind; anyway,
he had had nothing of the sort to reproach
himself with at twenty-five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not worthy of Andy—either as a
beneficed clergyman or a lover—that he should
sneak into the rose-garden next day during Sam’s
dinner-hour and cut the blooms surreptitiously,
afterwards secreting them in his bedroom washbasin.
Nor did it do any good. For when Mrs.
Jebb went there with a fresh pat of soap she put
the roses and a young lady together and made
matrimonial intentions out of the combination.
On the day of the luncheon-party she had suspected,
and her suspicions had fallen on Elizabeth
for the reason—unflattering both to Andy and
the Beloved—that Norah was certain to look
higher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So there was another person in it; and one quite
wanting in the sympathy felt by Sam Petch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a saying that everybody loves a lover,
but, though it sounds nice, it is not true; anyway,
it does not go far enough. Everybody loves a
lover in some one else’s household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, of course, Mrs. Jebb did not want Andy
to marry, because she would then certainly lose
one of her titles and be only lady-cook, and possibly
she might lose her place altogether. Therefore
she was anxious, and, being a nervous person,
she was also irritable, and being human, like all
the rest of us, she felt inclined to pass on some of
the discomfort to the cause of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she waited about the hall after luncheon,
dusting and rearranging, until Andy’s bedroom
door opened and she heard him coming downstairs.
She knew he would have the flowers in his
hand and that he would prefer to escape unobserved.
If not, why had he put them in his
washbasin instead of asking for a proper receptacle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kept very quiet, holding her breath and
looking up. Andy, also very quiet, craned his
head far over the banisters and looked down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now there is no reason in the world why a
gentleman should not lean over his own banisters
if he so desire, and there is equally no reason why
his lady-cook-housekeeper should not look up towards
the first landing; but the fact remains that
when the two pairs of eyes met they both blinked
with conscious guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—er—I was just wondering if you were
there,” said Andy. “Could you give me a bit of
string?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy—who was still boy enough always to
have string in his pockets!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mrs. Jebb said, almost at the same moment—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just looking at that crack in the ceiling.
I often wonder if it really is safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she remained in the hall, having procured
string from the hall-table drawer, and she busied
herself in polishing doors and skirting-boards
with such an air of having eternity at her disposal,
that Andy, after two or three noiseless sorties
upon the landing, was reduced to the necessity of
facing her with the roses in his hand or going
down the back stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave his hair a final dose of brilliantine to
subdue an objectionable curl on his forehead, and
came down the front stairs, armed with a bunch of
roses and an air of unapproachable dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all—so far as she knew—he might be
going to take them to some invalid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How beautiful!” murmured Mrs. Jebb as
he passed. “How it brings things back. I well
remember Mr. Jebb presenting me with just such
a bunch when he proposed; but his was surrounded
with maiden-hair fern. It seems a pity,
Mr. Deane, that you haven’t a little maiden-hair
to put with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy made no reply, and marched out of the
front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he walked along the pleasant field-paths
that lead to the Attertons’ house he began to lose
his sense of irritation, and to wonder vaguely if
Mr. Jebb could by any human possibility have
felt for Mrs. Jebb anything at all like he was
feeling then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed incredible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, Andy reflected, the longer you lived
the more you found out that people did think and
feel the most unsuspected things. For love and
nature together were opening Andy’s eyes, and he
began vaguely to see how very different people
are from what you think. Perhaps Mr. Jebb had
felt something the same, after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, when he neared the small park which
surrounded the Attertons’ house, he dismissed the
idea as ridiculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was quite sure no one at all had ever loved
any girl in just the wonderful and particular way
that he loved Elizabeth. He had invented it, and
it would die with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, of course, if he had not felt like that, he
would not have been a real lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the last quarter of an hour before he
rang the bell he was preparing phrases to use in
presenting the flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just saw some fine blooms as I came away,
and I thought you might like them, Miss Elizabeth.
I remember your saying you were fond of
roses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. That was too casual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw these roses in the garden and they
reminded me of you. So I brought them to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. That was too pointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he <span class='it'>wanted</span> to be pointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he saw a motor before the door and a
cart going round to the stables and was thus made
aware of a possibility that he had quite left out
of his calculations. There were other visitors in
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His throat grew quite dry with nervousness and
annoyance and disappointment, and he thought
he would hide the roses in a bush; but a certain
doggedness made him cling to them, and as he
stood undecided the Stamfords passed him in
their motor and he had to go on or look like a
fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he went on, and was ushered into a room
half full of people, where Elizabeth sat laughing
in a distant window-seat with Dick Stamford and
her brother Bill, and he had to account for the
roses in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How-do-you-do, Mrs. Atterton?” he heard
himself saying in a voice that sounded queerly
unfamiliar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ve brought me those roses? How
sweet of you,” said Mrs. Atterton in her good-natured
way, thinking he was shy and wanted
helping out. “I love roses!” She glanced
round with the eye of the born hostess. “Will you
take Miss Banks in to tea? Mr. Deane of Gaythorpe—Miss
Banks, the daughter of Mr. Banks,
the Rector of Millsby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Deane and I are <span class='it'>quite</span> old friends,”
said Miss Banks with animation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And half an hour later he came back to the
room to find his roses wilting on a side-table and
Elizabeth absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope your daughters are quite well?” he
remarked wistfully to Mr. Atterton, whom he
encountered on the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes. Norah’s away and Elizabeth is
playing tennis in the lower court, I expect,” said
Mr. Atterton carelessly, as if he were speaking of
any ordinary girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Elizabeth plays very well, doesn’t
she?” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No ... rotten service,” said Mr. Atterton,
and Andy felt he did not deserve to have such a
daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose the lower court is over there?”
suggested Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I say, would you like to come and see
my pigs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now pigs were, next to red villas, the main
interest of Mr. Atterton’s existence, and an invitation
to visit them in his company was a great
honour. What was a possible prospective son-in-law
to do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you very much,” said Andy, following
his host, and endeavouring to take an intelligent
interest in queer-looking and precious animals
that rather resembled a wild boar than the domestic
porker. He must have succeeded, for on leaving
to be in time for evensong, he received an
immense compliment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re like me,” said Mr. Atterton. “Pigs
more in your line than girls and tea-drinking,
hey?”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> year was just at that most pleasant pause
between hay-time and harvest, and the Vicarage
brooded in the sun amongst the full-leaved trees
like an architectural embodiment of repose. Quiet
joys seemed to cluster round its broad windows
like the roses, and a very faint ‘Coo-coo!’ from
the pigeons in Mr. Thorpe’s yard sounded like a
lullaby heard only by the soul—something too
deeply peaceful to be real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in spite of all that, there were three broken
hearts, or cracked hearts—anyway, hearts not in
a comfortable condition—under that very roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Elizabeth had receded, mentally and
physically, to a remote distance. She first departed
to some inaccessible region in a sort of
glory of white draperies and careless smiles when
Andy caught sight of her in the window-seat
across the blank distance of her mother’s drawing-room.
It seemed then incredibly audacious
that he could ever have dreamed what he had
dreamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to which she had actually gone to
stay with an aunt for a week, a fact of which Andy
was unaware; and he haunted the lanes where he
had sometimes met her in the past with so sad a
countenance, that such of his parishioners as met
him reported it was true—he <span class='it'>had</span> ruined his
stomach with over-eating—no young feller with a
good house and a decent income would go about
like that if he could digest his food. There was
no doubt a very good reason for his abstaining
from butter, as Mrs. Jebb told Miss Kirke he
continued to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Jebb herself. She also suffered—not
from blighted affection exactly, but from a
blight upon certain vague hopes which were ready
to ripen into affection. It was, she had felt on
coming to the Vicarage, notorious that young men
<span class='it'>did</span>, in the present age, often marry women old
enough to be their maiden aunts; and though Mr.
Jebb still loomed monumental in her heart, she
had a large heart, and there was plenty of room
for another occupant. So she went about her
work with a certain romantic melancholy that was
not unpleasant, and her sighs were like the wind
rushing sadly through those empty spaces which
Andy declined to fill. She was short with the
little maid, however, during those days, to a degree
that would have caused Sophy to rebel if she
had not been so full of her own concerns, and
inclined to disregard a universe on account of a
blue silk tie presented to another young lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, by the day previous to the school-treat,
there was a charged atmosphere at Gaythorpe
Vicarage, which only required a match to make
it explode; and the match was provided by Mrs.
Jebb in the shape of a gingerbread pudding, which
she had absently sweetened with carbonate of
soda, instead of sugar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy rang the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take this stuff away,” he said. “It is not
fit for human food. Tell Mrs. Jebb I wish to
speak to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the five minutes which elapsed before she
appeared, Andy’s wrath began to cool, and, unfortunately,
his courage cooled with it, so that
the dignified and stern rebuke which had been
waiting for her at the moment of tasting the
pudding petered out on her arrival into a rather
feeble—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Mrs. Jebb, this won’t do, you know.
You really must cook better than this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I entered your service,” said Mrs.
Jebb, whom Sophy had not spared in her recital
of the message, “I expected to be treated very
differently from what I have been in many ways. I
never expected to be sent for by cheeky maid-servants,
in a manner”—she paused, gulped, and
concluded—“that no gentleman should send for
a lady in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not only the pudding,” said Andy, nettled
afresh by this want of a proper attitude,
“it’s your cooking altogether. You must see
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Jebb’s interview with the triumphant
Sophy had left her in a state of mind that allowed
her to see nothing but a mist, through which
Andy’s boyish, reproving face loomed as a last
irritation. She wanted to box his ears, but replied
instead—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are not satisfied, I will go. Pray
accept my notice from this day forth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling vaguely that she had given notice in a
dignified, Biblical manner suited to her position
as housekeeper at a vicarage, she walked from
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when she reached the door the air
blew in from the garden, and a little shower of
rose-leaves fluttered down through the sunshine.
She stopped short with a sudden stunned contraction
of the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was she doing? What on earth was she
doing? Had she been mad?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She passed a handkerchief over her forehead
and came back slowly into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I apologise,” she said breathlessly. “My
temper got the better of me. Pray think no more
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy turned round from the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we will not discuss the matter further,”
he said. “Please consider your resignation
accepted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was pleased now at the thought of getting
rid of her—though if she had not given notice,
he would have kept her for an indefinite period,
with a man’s usual dislike for any change in his
domestic arrangements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” replied Mrs. Jebb, gathering
some remnants of dignity round her, “it must, of
course, be as you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She attempted to flutter with her usual light
air towards the door, but just before she reached
it she stopped short and began to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Mrs. Jebb,” said Andy, unable to
leave well alone, “you gave me notice, you know.
And you’ll find heaps of other places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?” said Mrs. Jebb, turning on him
with a sort of desperate sincerity that made all
her foolish little affectations fall from her like a
mantle, leaving the real woman—old, defenceless,
incapable—so nakedly plain for Andy to
see that he felt almost ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady-cooks,” he murmured—“there’s a
constant demand for lady-cooks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not very strong,” sobbed Mrs. Jebb.
“I couldn’t take an ordinary place. No—I
shall have to go back to my brother—and his
wife——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that will be pleasanter for you—with
relations,” suggested Andy cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the bitterness of the unwanted—which
is no less terrible because they do not deserve to
be wanted—gripped Mrs. Jebb’s soul and made
her jerk out in breathless sentences—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pleasant! To sit down to meals all the rest
of your life where you have to say you don’t
like anything tasty because there’s never enough
for three!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, it was no reason for retaining an incompetent
housekeeper, but there is something so
helplessly touching about every real self, when
the outside self which hides it fades away, that no
wonder Andy said, after a pause—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Mrs. Jebb. Have another go and
see how you manage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment longer Mrs. Jebb’s real self remained
visible while she leaned her head on the
door-post and mopped her eyes in speechless relief
and thankfulness; then it disappeared, and
she patted her fringe with a fluttered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How foolish of me! But I have become so
attached to Gaythorpe. I am so delighted that
our little misunderstanding has been cleared up.
I am so glad you spoke candidly, Mr. Deane. I
hope you always will in future if there is any little
matter you don’t like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she tripped into the hall with something of
her old airiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later Andy was bending over the plantains
on the lawn in the front part of the garden,
facing the road, and two women passed by on the
other side of the hedge without seeing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice house, I allus think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Rare thing being Parson Andy.”
Then they passed on, and their Vicar saw
through a hole in the hedge that it was the meek
and respectful Mrs. Burt who had spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ground his teeth. Parson Andy, indeed!
Then the undignified abbreviation was going to
dog him to his dying day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the last straw—he flung down his spud
and stalked into the house.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing in life is more interesting and queer
than the way in which every trifling event fits
into and influences the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For instance—Andy fell in love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That made him feel a new chivalry and kindness
towards all girls, particularly towards those
who lived in his own parish. It may have been
ridiculous, or it may not, but he became secretly
proud of their fresh looks and jealous of their
honour, like an elder brother. Several of them
sang in the choir-gallery whose families attended
chapel, and, one way or another, he knew nearly
every one in the parish by now, as a country parson
will in old-fashioned places. So when one of
those regrettable incidents occurred which happen
in all country parishes, he was inclined to forget
his casual knowledge of such affairs in London,
and to look on the thing as a personal outrage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no longer a vague girl who had taken a
wrong turning, but a definite Gladys Wilton,
whose life was spoilt, and a John Wilton, shepherd,
who went sorrowful and shamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falling in love with Elizabeth, therefore, had
made girls sacred to her lover, and that is rather
a fine thing to say of Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other events at work in Andy when he encountered
the author of the misfortune in a
lonely lane were, the difference with Mrs. Jebb,
the “Parson Andy” of the two women passing
the hedge, and, in the immediate present, a meeting
with a big young man instead of the eagerly
expected Elizabeth, who was still away from
home, though Andy did not know it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had walked miles, scanning the fields and
lanes round her house in vain, but not venturing
to call. So he was feeling tired, and irritable,
and more in love than ever. And the events mentioned
pushed him on into a course of action
which he would otherwise not have taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man, too, was looking very jolly,
with a pipe in his mouth and a good bicycle and
every evidence of self-satisfied prosperity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afternoon!” he said rather insolently, with
a smirk that irritated Andy still further. He had
been asked by old Wilton to speak to the young
man, and he suddenly made up his mind that
he would speak now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” he cried. “May I have a word with
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they entered into a conversation which began
all right, but ended, as it was bound to do under
the circumstances, by Andy calling the young man
a coward, and the young man calling Andy a
blanked, interfering parson, who only dared to
say things like that because he knew he wouldn’t
have to fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind a fight,” said Andy, beginning
to go white about the nose and to breathe heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one, of course, could maintain for one
moment that Andy was the right sort of parson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All very well to talk,” sneered the young
man, sticking a crimson face close to Andy’s.
“Do, then I’ll believe you! Parsons”—(he
used adjectives)—“we’ll soon have done with
parsons in this country” (and he used adjectives
again).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll fight you,” said Andy slowly, “if you’ll
promise to marry her if I win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you win, I will,” panted the young man.
“I can safely promise that. But you daren’t.
You’ll get me to start and have me up for assault.
I know you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thrust his face so near that his rough moustache
tickled Andy’s nose and that was enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy began to take off his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, for a few moments, ensued an unseemly
and unchristian scene which no friend of the Vicar
of Gaythorpe would wish to dwell on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to all the laws of fiction Andy ought
to have come off victorious, but, as a matter of
fact, he was badly beaten, and it was only by a
fluke that he managed to give his opponent a
black eye in return for his own damaged wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big young man silently watched him struggling
to put on his coat, then, with a hand over
the injured eye, assisted him into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know I’m the best boxer for ten miles
round?” he asked grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I believe I’d heard so,” replied Andy,
still very confused and hardly knowing what he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you made no more of going for me than
as if I’d been a counter-jumper?” continued the
young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forgot,” said Andy. “However——”
and he began to trudge on, very much ashamed of
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” said the young man. “I’ll tell
you a thing I didn’t mean to. There wasn’t no
need for you to fight me about Gladys. I promised
the old man last night I would marry her.
But I wasn’t going to tell you that when you
started jawing me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Andy. “Well, I’m glad,” and
he started to plod on again, very shaky about the
knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” said the young man, following
him, “you’re not fit to walk home. I gave you
a doing, I did. Here’s my bike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy looked at him and he looked at Andy, and
the virile souls of both met in that look and, in a
sense, shook hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Andy, mounting the bicycle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” the young man shouted after him,
“we were going to be married at the registry in
Bardswell, but you can marry us if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Andy called back over his shoulder.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> you live in a large community you feel it
possible to give an enemy a private black eye and
that there the matter ends—nobody’s business
but yours and his—and it is only when you live
in a little place that you realise the extraordinary
fact that there <span class='it'>are</span> no private black eyes—every
black eye affects the universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course every one knows this, but only
through the microscope of narrow lives do you
see the principle at work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which all means that Andy would not have
met Elizabeth at Marshaven if the young man
who was her aunt’s carpenter had not been obliged
to abstain from attending upon particular
widows; for Elizabeth would have been unable
to find any excuse which would possibly hold water
for coming into the little town on the day of
the school-treat. And her own self-respect—the
self-respect of a girl in such matters is a queer and
chancy thing—would not permit her to come in
without a decent excuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, a carpenter happened to be rather
urgently needed, and, as the young man’s father
was laid up with bronchitis, and the young man
himself had a black eye, Elizabeth volunteered to
walk over to Marshaven, a distance of about two
miles from her aunt’s house, which lay between
Millsby and the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the pony-cart,” entreated the aunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Elizabeth’s face assumed the expression
which her family knew well, and she walked.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, Gaythorpe had awakened early to
the sense of an outing, which is a vastly different
thing from just going out—as different as moonshine
from electric light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an outing has glamour and wonder in it,
and that precious atmosphere does still hang about
certain feasts and seasons in lonely places, not
because bicycles have not penetrated everywhere,
but because the Spirits of Ancient Revelry come
out from their hiding-places in barns and on deserted
greens, and whisper jolly tales of days when
men still had an appetite for fun—silly, childish,
inferior fun that meant nothing and led nowhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the very same spirit that had fled with a
shriek of the violin from the Attertons’ window,
properly banished after making a whole roomful
of people forget that they were earnest citizens
with only one purpose in life—to do well for
themselves and have a good time that should cost
money and look it—that very same spirit had the
cheek to venture forth again and tap at all the
windows in Gaythorpe village in the freshness of
the early morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the young people were used to bicycling
over to Marshaven on a Sunday afternoon,
and thought nothing at all of the few hours at the
sea which had been regarded as such a treat when
the School-Feast was first started, but even they
scanned the dewy, blue distance of the pasture-lands
with a feeling of joyous anticipation. And
in most of the farmhouses there was a pleasant
bustle of cutting ham-sandwiches, and packing
them in cabbage leaves to keep moist and cool
for the midday meal on the sands, and packing
cheesecakes in cardboard boxes for fear the light
pastry should break, and scalding cream, and
corking it down in bottles, because the milk provided
at the Marshaven refreshment-rooms was
no sort of use to a woman who was dog-tired with
walking about all day, and wanted a good cup of
tea to hearten her against the return journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a real outing is no brief run down to eat
and back again—it is a day stretching out full of
long, sunny hours, with sandwiches on the shore
at half-past twelve, and tea, provided by the ladies
of the parish, in a bare, high room at five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So by nine o’clock the three waggon-loads were
already rumbling down the village street. High
above the horses’ heads tossed the little arches of
paper roses and trembling grass, and the tiny
round bells jangled with every step, to make a
tune that the Spirit of Ancient Revelry knew well,
but which is as strange to us as a forgotten harvest-song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men and girls of the choir were there with
the school-children and school-teachers, but such
ladies as married Thorpes and Werrits would follow
later, aristocratic in gigs and dog-carts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy was in the last waggon, which had a
wreath of pink paper roses and green laurel all
round the body, with a bunch in the centre of each
wheel, and pink arches above the horses’ heads.
It was a common enough sight about Marshaven
between hay-time and harvest, but not to Andy;
and the sight of the fine horses and the waggons
in front, one trimmed with white, one with yellow,
and the sunlight shining so fresh and gay upon the
dewy hedgerows on either side, made him feel
as if he wanted to throw up his hat and sing, in
spite of his injured wrist and his other afflictions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It always is fine for the School-Feast,” said
Rose Werrit, who was a Sunday-school teacher,
and who sat on a bench in a glow of youth and
importance, with an arm round a fat boy of five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy—it is a disgraceful thing to have to
acknowledge—but Andy felt inclined to bend
over and kiss Rose’s pretty flushed cheek, and
yet he was tremendously in love with Elizabeth—perhaps
<span class='it'>because</span> he was so tremendously in love
with Elizabeth; but he caught back the wandering
impulse and felt ashamed of his own wickedness.
How could he——</p>

<p class='pindent'>But from that instant he began to feel less
harshly toward certain sinners whom he had before
condemned without a hearing. A little of
the tolerant humanity of Brother Gulielmus, who
had loved his flock so well, because he understood
them, began to mellow Andy’s crude judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, he turned his present attention to
Miss Fanny Kirke, who was forty-nine; and they
discoursed pleasantly of the weather and the approaching
holidays, and finally of Mr. Willie
Kirke, who was playing popular airs on a concertina
in the first waggon to lighten the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He really seems able to do anything,” said
Andy, with sincere admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always could,” said Miss Kirke. “Tiresome
about his meals, even as a child, wouldn’t touch
suet pudding or animal’s frys of any kind; but
made a windmill out of a card, a pin, and a stick
of firewood when he was five. I heard Mrs.
Stamford once call him quite the Admirable
Bright’un, and indeed he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy began to chuckle, then he turned it into
a cough. Miss Kirke had not intended a pun at
all, and she added in a very low tone, glancing at
Mrs. Jebb’s gauze veil that floated like a banner
from the next waggon—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is just the sort of man to be taken in by a
designing woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m sure——” remonstrated Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell me!” interrupted Miss Kirke, her
refinement for once upset by what was the obsessing
fear of her existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think it possible,” said Andy, unable
to pretend, in face of that eye fixed on the floating
veil, that he did not understand the drift of
her remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything’s possible,” said Miss Fanny Kirke
with some bitterness, “when you get a widow and
a man together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the waggons rumbled round that turning
where there first begins to be a cool saltiness in
the air, and little Jimmy Simpson called out, jumping
up on a seat—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I smell the sea! I smell the sea!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, you naughty boy. You’ll tummel
into the road,” said Sally, anxiously pulling at a
sturdy leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a kick and roared out—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want to tummel into the road!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now,” said Mrs. Simpson. “Jimmy
must be good, or else mother’ll take him home
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy eyed the long distance behind him for
a moment, then he replied—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You touldn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a lurch of the waggon pitched him into the
midst of a little nest of crowded baby figures,
and he condescended to sit down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sally looked across at Andy, because she and
her Vicar had become friends, and she said with
resignation—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll get drownded in the sea if I don’t have
him tied to me. Can you lend me a bit of
string?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll drown you too,” remonstrated Andy,
but he handed out the required string. It was
impossible to treat Sally as though she were a very
little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” she replied. “I should call out.
And I’ve a very loud skreek, haven’t I, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You make out Jimmy’s such a bad boy. I’m
sure he isn’t, the lamb,” said his mother, burying
her cheek in his curls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the lamb was disinclined for demonstrative
affection at that moment, and he fought her off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t want boys to sit still,” said Mrs.
Simpson, glancing round proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-no,” said Andy, as no one else replied.
“He’s a splendid little chap!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And indeed, as he struggled up again to stand
unsteadily in the sunshine above the other children,
with the full light on his bright hair and merry
face, he did seem the very embodiment of joy
and hope and roguish bravery—the things that
belong to the clean dawn of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope he’ll do well. I hope he’ll grow into
a splendid man,” said Andy suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or rather the words said themselves as he
watched the little laughing lad with his curls all
gold against the summer sky. Thus was the
father born in Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be getting on or the gallows with him,
bless him,” said Mrs. Simpson placidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the sea came in sight between a dip of the
sand-hills, and after a little more creaking and
jolting the waggons stopped outside the long refreshment-rooms
known all over the countryside
as ‘Walkers’,’ and every one went down to the
sands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy walked in the midst of a group of choirmen
and lads to the coco-nut shy, where it was
agreeable to the feelings of the Gaythorpe youth
that their Vicar knocked off no less than five coconuts;
they would have been ashamed of him if
he had missed. But after a while they dispersed
in different directions, and Andy walked sedately
along the shore with Mr. Kirke, discussing the
news of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little groups encountered and chatted with
them, and considered them important, and they
considered themselves more important still, and
everything was as it should be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is just in those placid moments that you
want to look out—for something nearly always
lurks round the next corner. In this case it was
Elizabeth. Not that she was lurking in any actual
sense, that being a thing she would disdain to do,
but she came along round a bend in the sand-hills
with the free wind blowing her blue gown about
her and the sunshine on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me—Miss Elizabeth Atterton!” said
Mr. Kirke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” said the Vicar. “Dear me, yes, I
see it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, Andy—when the world went golden like
the sands beneath her feet at the very sight of her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Deane! How very strange,” said Miss
Atterton with great aplomb, but with a colour
in her cheeks that had not been there when she
walked the shore alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha-ha! Yes. Just happened to be down
with the School-Feast,” said Andy, laughing at
nothing at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—the School-Feast—of course,” said
Elizabeth, as if it had that moment entered her
head. “And how are you getting on, Mr. Kirke?
Is Miss Kirke here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss Elizabeth. I—er—promised to
join her. I must hasten back now, I am sorry to
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So did Mr. Willie Kirke prove himself to be a
man and a brother as he skimmed back with a
light step by the damp edge of the waves, and
Andy remarked with heartfelt sincerity—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully good chap—the heart of a true
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so marvellously versatile,” added Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they strolled slowly along until they encountered
Sally, who had strayed from a group of
children round a shallow pool and was searching
the shore with her usual earnestness of purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not looking for shells—I’m looking for
money,” said Sally in a serious voice; and she
disengaged herself from Elizabeth’s detaining
hand to plod on again in a business-like manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no money on the sands, goosey,” said
Elizabeth, kneeling down to bring her own bright
head in a line with the little anxious face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sally looked at Elizabeth with that questioning
gaze by which children try to separate truth from
what are called jokes in a puzzling, grown-up
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard Miss Kirke telling mother there was
heaps of pennies lost on the sands,” she said;
“and mother doesn’t know how she’s ever going
to keep me and Jimmy in boots—we kick them
out so. She says we shall have to wear wooden
ones like little foreign boys and girls, and I don’t
w-want to. The others would s-shout us so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor little Sally’s voice broke at the prospect of
such unpleasant notoriety, and Elizabeth put her
arms round that dear, pitiful thing—a baby who
has learned to think too soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother was only joking about the wooden
shoes, ducky,” she comforted. “But I <span class='it'>have</span>
heard of people finding money on the sands; and
I’m rather a good looker. I nearly always find
things. Shall I help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y-yes, please,” said Sally, smiling through
the end of a sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as Andy looked at them, all the dreams
came back that he had known before—only glorified
because she was there; and the protecting
tenderness that marked her out always from other
girls seemed to him now so beautiful that he
adored it in her, as men for ages past have
adored it in the symbol of all loving womanhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll search too,” was all he said, however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Elizabeth, drying Sally’s eyes
with a little handkerchief that smelt of violets,
“here’s Mr. Deane going to help as well. We’re
certain to find some pennies now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an entrancing game, after that, to hide
pennies and then sixpences under little brown
heaps of seaweed behind Sally’s back while one
or other of them engaged her attention, and then
to hear her shrieks of joy as she pounced upon
them. It might almost be said that she became
young again as she flung herself down on the sand
and grubbed excitedly under a partly decayed starfish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ugh! Don’t touch that!” said Elizabeth.
“Look here. Here’s another penny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that proved to be the last, for the other
children were shouting that it was time for dinner,
and Mrs. Simpson was beckoning with a peremptory
umbrella from her seat on the sand-hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway,” said Sally, tying up the booty in
her microscopic handkerchief—“Anyway,
there’ll be enough to buy real boots for Jimmy. I
don’t know <span class='it'>what</span> we should do with him if he had
to wear anything that people shouted—he’d
never stop fighting. And the policeman might get
him after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There gleamed out the preoccupation of Sally’s
existence—the endeavour to prevent Jimmy’s behaviour
reaching a pass where the often-threatened
policeman really would do his duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Policeman <span class='it'>never</span> take baby boys like Jimmy.
Never!” said Elizabeth quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sally said nothing—that policeman was a
secret part of her life—and she felt vaguely
that Elizabeth knew nothing of the realities of
existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, queerly enough, she was happier than most
children can be, as she plodded up the sand-hills
to her mother with no less a sum than three and
ninepence halfpenny in her handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy and Elizabeth watched her for a moment,
and then turned towards a gap in the sand-hills
whence a road ran into the open country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way seems pleasanter,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sands <span class='it'>are</span> rather heavy,” agreed Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus fortified they walked rather quickly
until they reached a turning where a great sheet
of mustard-seed in flower stretched, pure blazing
yellow, beneath a cloudless blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was like an unexecuted flare of silver trumpets
on a still and joyous day, and Andy felt the
sudden, triumphant exhilaration of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth——” he began—face shining—eyes
alight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the aunt and cousins who were not expected
in Marshaven until the following week
came round the corner, and the Vicar of Gaythorpe
used an expression in the presence of the
lady he adored which, one second earlier, he
would have deemed himself absolutely incapable
of using in the presence of any lady at all. “I
beg your pardon,” he added hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Elizabeth may have felt obliged to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These,” said Andy, muddling the introduction
in the agitation of his feelings—“these are
my cousins and aunt—at least my aunt, Mrs.
Dixon and the Webster girls—Miss Elizabeth
Atterton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he openly mopped his brow—anybody
would—even the most refined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do? I have heard Mr. Deane
speak of you very often,” said Elizabeth, with a
heightened colour but surprising composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stared at her in astonishment, unable to
understand how she did it, for that is a thing no
man can understand until he has been married for
at least a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted to meet any of Andy’s friends,”
said Mrs. Dixon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy scowled. So here was the adored learning
the undignified name when he wished her always
to think of him as Andrew. That was the
worst of relatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we quite look on Andy as a brother,
though he is no real relation,” added Irene Webster,
swinging her sunshade with an air of great
fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite a nice little place—Marshaven—if
you want to get away from the rush,” said Phyllis.
“You can fancy yourself a tripper, and lead the
simple life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, high up in the top of her head,
and Andy and her family followed suit, though
there was nothing to laugh at, because she considered
herself smart, and they had formed a
habit of applause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Elizabeth thought she must be going, as
she had to make a call in Marshaven—she did
not say that the call was upon the carpenter—and
Andy said he would walk part of the way with
her, because he was due to lunch on the sands with
Mrs. Thorpe, who had arrived with an overflowing
dog-cart at 12.30.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Elizabeth said that the call was exactly in
the opposite direction to the sands, and that she
could not, and would not, separate Andy from his
new-found relatives, so they all walked together
to the dip in the sand-hills whence Mrs. Thorpe
was plainly visible, large and black like a derelict
buoy that had been thrown upon the shore, with
other members of the congregation scattered
near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the ladies stood in a group to say farewell—Mrs.
Dixon, tight about the figure and curly about
the head, as she had been from Andy’s very earliest
recollections of her, with a perennial purple
dusting of powder on her face—, Irene, very like
her mother, only willowy instead of tight—and
Phyllis more willowy still. Both girls had an indescribable
air of possessing more neck and more
eyes and more hair than other people, though of
course this could not have been the case, and it
was only an optical delusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy really felt very proud of them now the
first awkwardness of meeting was over, and he
thought Elizabeth and the girls would get on
splendidly together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure to meet again,” he said encouragingly.
“I hope my aunt and cousins will come
to stay with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—a bachelor’s household—and three
women——” smiled Mrs. Dixon, shaking her
head. “But we shall often go over. You will
get quite tired of us in the neighbourhood, Miss
Atterton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Webster girls went off in one direction,
while Elizabeth took another, thinking how
pleased Mr. Kirke would be if he could only get
his dancing class to willow like that; and Andy
plodded down the soft sand in the full sun to Mrs.
Thorpe, realising, as he had not done before, that
he had injured his damaged arm further by the
coco-nut shying, and that it was beginning to be
exceedingly uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After lunch there were games to be started for
the children and races to be run for prizes, and no
time at all could be had for dwelling on a certain
high moment that shone in a blending glory of
blue and yellow at the back of Andy’s mind. At
five o’clock followed a meat tea in the bare, high
room, where some of the young men were late
owing to a travelling circus which had put up its
tent for a couple of performances. And as everybody
filed out into the open air afterwards, very
hot, and exuding ham fat quite visibly, young Sam
Petch came up to Andy with an air of mysterious
importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I have a word, sir, in private?” he
said, shading his mouth with his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? Anything wrong?” said Andy,
sharply alert—no longer a jolly boy but a leader
with precious human lives under his care—something
of what he might become shining clear and
hard through the mists of youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, sir,” said Sam Petch soothingly.
“Only you asked me to be on the look-out for a
cheap little pony and cart, and I believe I’ve got
an offer such as you’ll never see the like of again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—I can’t now——” began Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” entreated Sam, “it’s only the matter of
a minute. The circus is doing badly this summer.
Weather too fine. And the owner’s up a gum-tree
for a ten-pound note.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you hear of it?” said Andy, almost
unconsciously following his handy man
round a corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I always pick up news—overheard him
telling somebody,” said Sam, forbearing to mention
that the information was acquired in the bar
of the Blue Tiger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy glanced at him once or twice—but said
no more. After all, nobody could swear he had
been drinking beer—they could only be quite
certain that he had eaten peppermints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always have to eat one after a full meal,”
said Sam. “Had a delicate stomach ever since I
ate some tinned lobster that had been away from
the sea a bit too long. Oh, here’s the little turnout,
all ready and waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His air of ingenuous surprise showed what he
might have done had his lines been cast in dramatic
circles, and so did the honest way in which
he said to a seedy, flashy man—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, mind, I’m not going to advise this
gentleman to buy. He must see for himself, and
judge for himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s worth fifty. I’ll take twenty for it,”
said the owner, rather thickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy looked at the little brown pony and the
green cart picked out with red—it certainly was
marvellous at the price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here. I’ll just ask Mr. Thorpe or Mr.
Werrit——” he said, turning to go back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam put a hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, sir, but this is a private job—very
private. This gentleman doesn’t want any
one to know he has to sell the cart. Says it would
ruin his circus right off. I only heard by accident,
and he’s bound me over to keep quiet. Any
honourable man would keep quiet under them circumstances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Andy uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fact is,” said the man, “it’s twenty pound
down now or nothing. Theatrical business is
like that—all of it. One day a thousand means
nothing to you and the next day you’ll sell your
soul for a five-pound note.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do not wish to take advantage——”
began Andy with the air Sam knew and dreaded,
for it upset his calculations because it was an
unknown quantity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You aren’t taking advantage,” he interposed,
with bluff honesty, as man to man. “It doesn’t
matter to me—only I’ve been in a bit of an ’ole
myself at times, and I thought I’d do this chap a
good turn and you too, if I could. Don’t often
get such a chance. But <span class='it'>I</span> don’t care, not for myself,
I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his hands into his pockets, whistled
mildly a favourite air, and, as it were withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll own,” said the circus-owner reluctantly,
“that you’ll be doing me a good turn if you take
it. So you needn’t keep back on that account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I haven’t twenty pounds with me,” objected
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you send a cheque to-night that I can get
by first post in the morning, it’ll do,” said the
owner. “Then your man can drive it back with
him to-night. But I must have the money first
thing in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said Andy. “So long as you can
assure me that the transaction is perfectly honest
and legal. I must have some proof that you
really are the owner of the circus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in here,” said the man sullenly, marching
into the Blue Tiger and addressing the highly
respectable landlord of that inn. “Look here.
Am I the owner of Kennington’s Royal Circus, or
am I not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are,” said the landlord, whom nothing
astonished any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll swear it?” said the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landlord cocked a placid and incurious eye
at Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If necessary I’ll swear it,” he said weightily.
“Mr. Deane of Gaythorpe, I believe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Er—yes,” said Andy. “A little matter of
business——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so,” said the landlord. “Quite so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went to draw three-pennyworth of
whisky for a customer, and Andy, Sam, and the
circus-owner filed out again in the by-lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have it,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done with you,” said the man, leading the
pony and cart back into the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My eye, you’ve got a bargain,” said Sam.
“Cheapest pony and cart I ever see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And indeed it was a wonderful bargain, only to
be accounted for by the fact that the circus-owner
decamped next day, leaving behind a wife, a tent,
a few assorted animals, and the responsibilities of
existence in the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately for himself, Andy never knew that
he had provided the means of flight, but as the
wife prospered much better alone it may be assumed
that the circus-owner was no irretrievable
loss to the circus or the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time the bargain was concluded, the
waggons were already rumbling up to the door of
the refreshment-rooms, and tired and happy babies
cuddled down against their mothers’ knees to
sleep all the way home, while the bigger ones sang
hymns that sounded very sweet and touching, in
spite of the rough, untrained voices, as they floated
back in the still, evening air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all very tired—young and old—but
you want to be tired after a real outing, for
that is a part of it—and as Mr. and Mrs.
Thorpe, the solid and unemotional, followed in
their dog-cart behind, they could hear all three
waggon-loads singing “Abide with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another School-Feast over,” said Mr.
Thorpe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Thorpe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all they said aloud, but one of those
wonderful unspoken conversations went on between
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many more School-Feasts shall we see?”
was what Mr. Thorpe’s heart said to Mrs.
Thorpe’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And hers said to him—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are more behind us, dear, than before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, clear and faint, came the end of the
hymn across the quiet fields—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Abide with me, fast falls the eventide,</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Any</span> gentleman who begins a sentence by saying
“Elizabeth”—in the tone which Andy used
near the mustard-field at Marshaven, is bound, if
he be a man of honour, to complete that sentence
at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Should he be suffering from a very painful arm—as
Andy was—and should the skies look like
a storm—as they did above Gaythorpe the next
morning—so much the worse for the gentleman;
but the thing has to be done at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy put on his best coat with a good deal
of difficulty, and cut himself in shaving, and ate a
poor breakfast, and finally set forth in the new
pony-cart to call upon Elizabeth at the house of
her aunt, with a bleak and desolate feeling, as if
he were going off in a tumbril to his own execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It does not sound romantic, but it is true, and
it is none the less true that Andy was as much in
love with the girl as any young and ardent man
who has not frittered his emotions away can be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the cool sweet air blew on his forehead
as he drove along the lanes, and calmed his
nerves, which were fretted by pain and suspense
and a sleepless night. Andy began to feel better,
and to forget everything but the fact that he loved
her and would soon see her. He could not help
thinking there was hope for him, because of a
look that had come across her face when he said
the fateful “Elizabeth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s reflections broke short at that point,
and the grey summer world under a low sky
seemed suddenly strange and unreal—nothing
was vividly real to him in that moment but a blaze
of blue and yellow and a girl’s face—all life
since he was born seemed only to have been the
dim antechamber to that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whipped up the pony, who really might
have known that he was a substitute for the wings
of love so sportingly did he respond, and as his
little hoofs clicked on the hard road they made a
merry sound that was pleasant to hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love’s all—folly. But it’s—jolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the gay little hoofs kept beating out all the
way to the house of Elizabeth’s aunt; but Andy
would have felt annoyed at such a sentiment if he
had not been too engrossed to hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was square, and extremely substantial,
and rather ugly—just the house, somehow,
where one would expect a widowed aunt to dwell—and
the very superior parlour-maid who came
to the door was just the sort of servant one would
have expected a widowed aunt to engage; for this
aunt really was, in many useful and profitable
ways, particularly to herself, an epitome of the
expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only unexpected thing she ever did was to
omit having a family, and that was why the Atterton
girls were obliged to stay with her rather
more than they felt inclined to do; for an epitome
of the expected is honoured by all and gets everything,
but is not usually a great favourite with nice
young people who have no wish to be remembered
in her will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the kindness that underlay everything in
the daily life of the Attertons, without ever being
seen or spoken of, made it a matter of course
that the girls should go over for a week when they
were wanted. Norah went less often that Elizabeth,
because of her public engagements and her
Club in London; still, she took her turn all the
same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Miss Elizabeth Atterton at home?” said
Andy, his heart hammering so loudly against his
ribs that he thought the superior maid must hear
it and wonder. But she replied with a calm which
was equal to that of any powdered footman—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at home, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may sound foolish, or as if Andy were the
neurotic young man he certainly was not, but the
bare fact remains that Andy felt physically sick
and the garden rocked about him. The reaction
was so great, and the feverish night had unnerved
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will she be back?” he managed to ask
at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the superior housemaid proved that soft
hearts do beat even under starched garments, and
a demeanour so stiff that any softness at all might,
at first sight, seem incredible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ladies have gone out for the day, sir,”
she replied. “I’m sorry to say they won’t be
back until evening.” She paused, then added, in
almost a confidential tone, “Can I give any
message?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please tell Miss Atterton I called, and was
sorry to find her out,” he said dejectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.” The parlour-maid had once had a
young man in the weak and low-waged past, and
she knew how it felt. “May I offer you any
refreshment, sir? I am sure my mistress would
wish——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you,” said Andy, climbing back
into his cart. “Good morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Good</span> morning, sir,” said the parlour-maid
feelingly. “I hope you’ll get home before the
storm starts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy did not care, as he jogged along
home again, whether the rain fell or not. He
had come in the cart so as to present an immaculate
appearance to the Beloved and the Beloved’s
aunt, and he had used nearly quarter of a bottle
of brilliantine to ensure his curls remaining flat
under any stress of circumstance, and now she
was out. He didn’t care what happened after
that. Somehow he had never expected her to be
out when he wanted to ask her to marry him. He
felt vaguely that fate ought to have waited on
so important an event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pony took his own time, clicking doggedly
on the long way back, “Come on—Come on—Come
<span class='it'>on</span>,” and about half-way home a heavy
thunderstorm broke over the country, lightning
zigzagged in streaks across the horizon, and at
length followed a deluge of rain. Andy had
brought no mackintosh or overcoat, and the big
drops whistled down in sheets from a still, low
sky upon his shoulders and the pony’s back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was such a storm as sometimes comes in an
English summer after a long spell of dryish
weather, and it seemed capable of going on for
ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy eyed the landscape with a dreary gaze,
and felt a savage pleasure in being as uncomfortable
as possible until he remembered that his
best suit was being ruined, and that the pony and
cart had absorbed all his available spare cash. If
the time ever came when the Beloved <span class='it'>were</span> at
home—but that now seemed vague and improbable—he
would have to court her in his second-best
suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another grievance against fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was surveying the trotting pony with an
uninterested gaze, including even that new and
cherished possession amongst the things that did
not matter, when his glance suddenly sharpened.
What on earth——? He jumped out of the cart
and ran round to the pony’s left side. Yes, his
sight had not deceived him. A faint patch of
yellowish drab <span class='it'>was</span> appearing where before had
been only a rather different shade of brown. And
there was another similar patch on the animal’s
hindquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at the pony, and the pony flicked
his tail as much as to say, “This is really no
affair of mine—I must leave it for you humans
to settle among yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy climbed back into the trap again, and
drove for another hour through the deluge with
an eye upon the increasing paleness of the drab
patches. By the time he reached Gaythorpe he
was driving an openly and flagrantly piebald pony
in a green cart picked out with bright red, and
it really did look a little gay for a country vicar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sam!” shouted Andy at the top of his voice,
as he drove into the great stable-yard where the
little pony was to reign alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir!” called Sam, running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” said Andy, pointing to the
patches that were now cream-colour. “What’s
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Struck with lightning!” cried Sam dramatically.
“Well! it’s a mercy it wasn’t you, sir.
That’s all I can say. But shock will turn hair
white in animals as well as people. I remember
my poor old aunt had a white patch over her left
ear ever after the roof fell in one stormy night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy looked at his henchman. “Come to me
in the house in half an hour,” was all he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sam knew that this was one of his rare failures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About half an hour later the Vicar sat in dry
clothes, drinking hot tea, and awaiting the culprit.
He was irritated, chilled through, and as like the
senior curate as he had ever been in his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gather,” he remarked when Sam appeared,
“that you were aware of the—er—tinting of
the animal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam faced him as one honest man another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t deny I were aware,” he said. “I
won’t deny it. I’d seen the pony <span class='it'>before</span> the owner
knowed the likely customer was a clergyman, and
<span class='it'>after</span>. But he told me on his sacred oath that
the stuff he’d put on was permanent. ‘Stand the
little beggar under a tap for a year, and it won’t
wash off,’ was his very words. And I thought
what a man doesn’t know he can’t grieve about,
so I kept it to myself. I was sure, being a
clergyman with a quiet taste, that you’d rather <span class='it'>not</span>
know he was so circussy underneath. And he
was dirt cheap. Piebald <span class='it'>or</span> plain, he was dirt
cheap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that,” said Andy, “but what I object
to is the dishonest dissimulation—yes, I can call
it nothing else, dishonest dissimulation on your
part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did it for the best,” said Sam with humble
simplicity. “I wanted you to have a good pony
and a cheap pony, and not to be bothered thinking
if it was fit for a clergyman’s household or
not, and I did it all for the best. But I made a
mistake. I ought to have been more straighterer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anything else”—Andy paused for
a word—“unusual about the animal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam scratched his chin and replied with reluctance—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—there’s just one thing—he waltzes
when he hears a band. Only there never <span class='it'>is</span> a
band.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to know,” said Andy, rising and
standing in a dignified attitude with a hand on a
book, “what <span class='it'>you</span> got out of this transaction?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Sam threw himself, as it were, upon
Andy’s mercy, and looked his master straight in
the eye, with an honesty indescribable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be straight with you,” he said. “The
man offered me half a crown, and I took it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He omitted to mention the other seventeen and
six, because he felt that was between himself and
the landlord of the Blue Tiger, where much of
it had been expended, but he did, after a great
deal of fumbling in a dingy pocket, produce a
half-crown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it is,” he said in a voice charged with
manly feeling. “You take it, sir. It justly belongs
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want your half-crown,” said Andy
hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I can easily sell the pony and trap for
what you gave,” pursued Sam. “Hall, the butcher
at Millsby, wants one for his wife. He’d
jump at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll think the matter over,” said Andy.
“You can go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he was alone the hot tea began to
stimulate him, and he had a very pleasant sensation
of repose after all the fresh air, following
his sleepless night, and his depression suddenly
lifted in that odd way which every one recognises
who suffers from it at all. It is as if a cloud
passed away from the spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy began to see that the end of everything
was not come because he could not see Elizabeth
for twenty-four hours. Then he remembered
how the little pony had trotted on through
the sunshine and through the rain like the game
little creature it was, and he began to feel the
first stirring of that affection which a decent man
has for the horse or the dog that serves him faithfully.
No, he would keep the pony, though it
was such a secular-looking little animal, and he
would go out now to see if the hot mash had been
administered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stuffed a few lumps of sugar from the basin
into his pocket, and went out into the stables,
where he found Sam. He was afraid Sam would
have to go after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enjoying his feed, sir. Not a penny the
worse,” said the culprit with a sort of chastened
pleasantness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he glanced at the cream-coloured spots
and his mouth began to twitch, and he caught
Andy’s eye, and Andy’s mouth was twitching too,
and before they knew where they were, the big
echoing stable was ringing with uproarious laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg pardon, sir, but it sort o’ came over me
how funny it was,” gasped Sam, wiping his eyes.
“When I see you drive in—all piebald—when
you’d gone out plain brown—you might have
knocked me down with a feather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy wiped his eyes, too, and pulled himself
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought not to have lied about it, Sam.
Why did you say the pony was struck by lightning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam rubbed the back of his head and eyed Andy
apologetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a silly thing to say. But I had to say
something. And it jumped out of itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a sad pity that lies should jump out so
easily,” said Andy, trying to erase the memory of
that unclerical laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, sir,” agreed Sam. “I’ve often thought
so myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that Andy returned to the house and slept,
and woke up stiff for evensong, and came back
from the church to dress for dinner at the Stamfords’,
where he had promised to go that evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It already seemed so long a time since he had
talked to Elizabeth in the sunshine that he could
scarcely believe it was only yesterday.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>After</span> the dull day and the storm a bright sun
broke through the clouds and slanted in long
mellow rays across the wet country. Every flower
and herb gave out scent, and there was a sense of
indescribable sweet freshness in the air as Andy
stood at the gate leading into the Stamfords’
garden, and looked at the village through a gap
in the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little whitewashed houses and red-brick
ones, grown lovely with time, clustered together
round the grey church among the trees, in a bower
of small flowery gardens and climbing roses and
honeysuckle. Andy saw then, why some poet
once upon a time had looked at it so, and called it
Gaythorpe: though the present generation jeered
at the name being given to a place that was over
three miles from a station and had no modern
improvements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gay!” they would say. “Call <span class='it'>this</span> gay?
Now, Blackpool’s gay, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy walked up to the Stamfords’ door
with a very tender feeling in his heart for the little
place that smiled in the sunshine after rain,
with something of the exquisite pathetic radiance
of a child laughing through tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that moment he loved Gaythorpe—the
place itself—apart from the people, or his work
amongst them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he entered the drawing-room Mrs. Stamford
was there alone, as she had been on the first
occasion that he took a meal in the house, and her
appearance in evening dress was just of the same
startlingly unfinished kind as her day attire. By
some accident somebody seemed to have thrown
a necklace round her neck and it had remained—but
it was quite impossible to feel that Mrs. Stamford
had had anything to do with its getting there.
And her hair was somehow a distinct protest
against the low neck, though it would have been
impossible to picture her at that hour of the day
in anything but a low neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced out of the window after greeting
Andy, and remarked—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This rain will do old Sam Petch’s garden
good. He cried yesterday when my husband
went to see him because his marigolds were dried
up. I fear he is failing at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy looked at her, and suddenly he saw too,
how the Stamfords and Gaythorpe were one—welded
together by generations of common interests.
It was as natural for Mr. Stamford to
drive down to see old Sam Petch as it was for him
to sit in his own garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy recalled the “visiting of the poor,” which
he had heard and seen, and knew that he was
witnessing the last of a vanishing system which
may or may not have been good but was quite
certainly beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Stamford takes a great interest in old
Sam Petch,” was all Andy found to say out of
these many thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Interest!” said Mrs. Stamford. “Why, old
Sam worked for my husband’s grandfather, and
he used to make whistles out of cabbage-stalks for
Dick when he was a boy.” She paused. “By
the way, I’m so glad you and Dick are friends.”
She paused again. “If there is anything at all
you are wanting for the church or village——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy smiled at her in a way most women would
have found pleasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing I want. And I’m only too
delighted to come up for a game of billiards whenever
your son asks me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another of those unspoken conversations—full
of difficult pride and mother-love on the one side,
and touched recognition of it on the other—but
perfectly clear to both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very rare colour crept up into Mrs. Stamford’s
weather-beaten cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all we have,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” Andy answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the other two came in, and they all went
through the atmosphere of reposeful centuries
to dinner, when the conversation dragged sufficiently
for Andy to search his mind for a fresh
topic, and he introduced his aunt and cousins with
a feeling that this was just what they would like.
And he was quite sure Mrs. Stamford would like
them, for they were social lights fitted to adorn
any circle, and such very stylish dressers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not say this in so many words, but his
boyish gratitude to his aunt and admiration for
the Webster girls shone sufficiently clearly through
the remarks he did make to cause Mrs. Stamford’s
cordial—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be delighted if you will bring your aunt
and cousins to lunch with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy little knew how seldom such an invitation
was issued by his exclusive hostess, and he
was conscious of promising equal enjoyment to
both entertainer and entertained when he replied
gratefully—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you very much. I am sure they would
like to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon afterwards the two young men adjourned
to the billiard-room, while Mr. Stamford went
to his sofa, exhausted by one of his painful and
tedious days which became more frequent as time
went on, and Mrs. Stamford played with determination
certain hard pieces on the piano to distract
the invalid, not because they gave her the
slightest pleasure, but because it was the duty of a
wife to play music to her sick husband if she knew
how.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through a series of open doors the sound of
correct and metallic “runs” penetrated even to
the billiard-room, and caused Dick Stamford to
remark irreverently—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the mater giving the poor old dad
piano exercise again. She does believe in keeping
things going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was walking to a little table containing
whisky and soda and cigars as he said this, and he
raised the whisky decanter, tilted it over the glass,
then paused an irresolute second and put it down
with the remark—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a good sort, is the mater, all the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy turned away his head and answered
casually—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anybody can tell that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his whole being was filled with a sudden
rush of pity and comprehension and an intense
desire to help. He felt he could go on for ever
walking interminable miles round that billiard-table
if it could do any good. He wanted, almost
more than he had ever wanted anything in his
life, to do something which should strengthen this
weak man for the fight against such a tremendous
enemy. Every instinct of backing the weak
against the strong which had grown with him from
boyhood, became focused and alert. But he
could only say, after all—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry I can’t play billiards to-night. I’ve
hurt my arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a bore! How?” said Dick Stamford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, got it strained a bit,” said Andy. “Soon
be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll have a smoke instead,” said Stamford,
drawing a chair to the empty fireplace and
putting his feet on the fender-stool. He was not
in the least drunk, but he had taken enough whisky
during the day to make him confidential and talkative,
and he gave Andy to understand that when he
was with the regiment he had enjoyed a gay and
lurid past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not like some parsons,” he said. “A
chap can make a friend of you. You know there
<span class='it'>are</span> such things as chorus girls—eh? What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only ones I ever met were dull,” said
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dull!” The bare originality of the suggestion
struck Stamford dumb. How <span class='it'>could</span> a chorus
girl be dull?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too jolly pleased with themselves to have any
sort of humour,” maintained Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s a woman want with a sense of humour?”
said Dick Stamford—and it must be
owned that there he spoke for his sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—the Atterton girls—they’ve got any
amount,” suggested Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stamford leaned forward in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and between you and me that’s the one
thing I don’t like about ’em. Norah, now; you
never quite know if she isn’t getting at you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can’t say that of Miss Elizabeth,”
said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. No, you can’t say that of Elizabeth.”
He paused, and added very confidentially, “I
shouldn’t be doing the good little boy as I have
been doing the last eight months if you could say
that of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stared at him but said nothing, because
he could not—all sorts of unheeded incidents were
crowding into his mind so quickly that he felt as
if it would burst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fact is—I’m on probation. If I behave, I
may pay my addresses to Miss Elizabeth Atterton
next October. Old Atterton doesn’t want it,
but Mrs. does, because Elizabeth would live next
door, so to speak, instead of perhaps going off to
India or goodness knows where. And I believe
the mater would go straight up to heaven in a sort
of bust of thankfulness if it ever came off. But
I’ve promised on my honour to say nothing to her
until next October, so of course I can’t. Rum
situation, isn’t it?” And he drew a long whiff
of his cigar and leaned back with the consciousness
of being interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stared at the stove and still said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queer, ain’t it?” said Stamford, a little surprised
at this lack of sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Andy got up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” he said. “I’m in love with Miss
Elizabeth Atterton. I want to marry her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stamford gazed at him with unflattering astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You!” he said. “My dear chap—they’d
never look at you. Don’t you know they’re rolling
in money and consider those girls Venuses?
Why, they wouldn’t think <span class='it'>me</span> good enough, even
if I were as steady as you are, if I didn’t own a
place next door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I’m a bad match. I know I’m not
to ask her,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Stamford with slight alcoholic
emotion, “we’ve been pals, you and I. I never
thought you’d go and steal a march on me when
my hands were tied and I couldn’t do anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve—I’ve sort of half proposed,” said Andy,
turning very red. “I must go on. She’ll think it
so dishonourable if I don’t, whether she likes me
or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well,” said Stamford, rising and
walking across the room to the whisky and soda.
“You are perfectly within your right, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He jolted out a stiff glass and drank it off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s thoughts ran round and round like a
rat in a trap as he sat watching. Then something
in the lad which underlay all his clerical affectations
and easy immaturity rose up and made itself
felt. It was that germ—that something—which
has informed the saints of all creeds and all ages,
and with which a very human, faulty man may be a
saint, and without which no man can be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll—if you’ll keep clear of that—I’ll
wait,” he said. “We’ll take an equal chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What business is it of yours whether I drink
or not?” demanded Stamford violently—only he
used other terms which it is unnecessary to repeat.
“And you’d have no earthly chance with her, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But certain unnoticed incidents were also crowding
into his mind now, and he was sufficiently in
love with Elizabeth to feel outraged at the thought
of any other man proposing to her. He was
more in love with her at that moment, as a matter
of fact, than he ever had been before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether I have any chance or not, I mean to
ask her,” said Andy steadily. “But I’ll play fair.
I’ll wait until you are free!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you think you are mighty magnanimous,”
replied Stamford unpleasantly. “Do you
propose that we should walk up to the lady arm-in-arm,
and say, ‘Which of us will you have?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a difficulty which certainly had not
presented itself to Andy, but he grappled with
it in a desperate—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s write then! So that she gets both letters
by the same post.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stamford kicked the fender-stool in silence for
a moment or two, then he said suddenly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a good chap, Deane. My father knew
what he was doing when he liked the look of you,
and asked you to accept Gaythorpe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was odd I should happen to be preaching
that morning,” said Andy dully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Preaching! Why, you don’t suppose your
<span class='it'>sermon</span> had anything to do with it, do you? If
it had, you and I would never have hit it off as we
have done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did he offer me the living, then?” said
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he saw you were a decent chap, and young
and all that, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that was it, was it?” said Andy. “Well,
I think I’ll be going. My arm bothers me a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queer thing. If it hadn’t been for your bad
arm we should never have had this talk. We
should have been playing billiards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Queer thing! It was indeed, thought poor
Andy as he went home. First he owed his meeting
with Elizabeth at Marshaven to his fight with
the carpenter, and now this conversation. He
realised more acutely than ever that there are in
the world no private black eyes or damaged arms.
They all concern the Universe.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Any</span> one who has ever gone home after a great
shock, hurrying along, and keeping the tearing
thoughts of it at bay until a place is reached where
they can be fought alone, will know how Andy
felt as he went back to the Vicarage that evening.
And those who have not felt it themselves could
never understand how he struck the match left for
him by Mrs. Jebb in the dark hall, and lighted the
candle and stumbled up to bed, still fighting off
the realisation of what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he was in his own bedroom, and had
locked the door, he sat down on his bed and let
it come. It had to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So all this time there had been some sort of
understanding between Elizabeth and Dick Stamford—or,
if not exactly that, some arrangement
of which she must have been aware. Mrs. Atterton
was not the woman to keep such a thing to
herself, even if her husband thought it politic to
do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He—Andy—was only another of the suitors,
who doubtless crowded round that pleasant, affluent
household with the two charming daughters.
It was his own idiotic conceit which had made
him hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he remembered the look he had seen on
Elizabeth’s face by the flaring blue and yellow at
Marshaven, and he wondered if she did care,
after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he recalled that visit when she had chatted
in a distant window-seat with Stamford, not noticing
him, while he took in to tea a garrulous Miss
Banks, and the despair which is always waiting
for the true lover because he thinks himself unworthy,
gripped poor Andy’s vitals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course she would never look at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still—she had looked: she had done more,
she had let him touch her arm as they stood close
together, laughing, in Mrs. Petch’s kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groaned—the contrast between that exquisite
moment and this was too great to bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the pleasant certainty which had undoubtedly
lurked at the bottom of Andy’s mind, fostered
by the opinion he had unconsciously gained
during his London curacy that men <span class='it'>were</span> rather
rare birds, and all women pleased to catch them,
was swept away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wouldn’t have him. She would never have
him. Elizabeth!</p>

<p class='pindent'>If he could only go and ask her, and so make
sure——</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he couldn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gates of Andy’s soul clashed to on such
a temptation with a vibration that roused him
from his despair: but the sight of the spacious
wall on which his shadow flickered brought back
the memory of that other blow, which in the first
agony of love’s suspense he had forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He owed all this, then, to the fact that Mr.
Stamford needed a companion for his son—a
young fellow who should not be too old or too
clever to disdain such companionship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, Andy was no fool, once his eyes were
opened, and he saw that plainly enough now.
But it is a painful thing to be wounded in one’s
vanity—more keenly smarting than to be wounded
in one’s love, though without the dull ache that
love’s hurts leave behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to the window and pulled up the blind.
There was no moon, but it was a light night with
stars, and he could see clearly the gravestones in
the churchyard, and the dim whiteness of the lilies
in the garden. He felt he could not stay within
those four walls any longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was intensely quiet in the midst of
the starlit silence, and he dreaded above all things
to have Mrs. Jebb peering at him over the banisters
in curling pins and dressing-gown as he went
out of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked down at the ivy beneath the window—the
growth of fifty years—and crept down upon
that green ladder provided by his predecessor into
the free coolness of the summer night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wet grass soaked his thin boots as he crept
cautiously across the lawn, and out by the churchyard
path. Once out of sight of the house, he
paused, and stood leaning against the gate with
his hands in his pockets. The fact of doing something
had diverted his thoughts for a while, and
now a sort of dull depression settled down upon
him—that horrible dull time after a storm of
emotion, when nothing seems worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in that storm the mantle of the senior
curate—good man that he was, with a real desire
to serve his Master his own way—had been blown
away from Andy’s shoulders for ever. It never
fitted, or perhaps it would have clung more
closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was just a lad doubtful of himself, and
of everything else, who stumbled miserably down
the churchyard path in the uncertain light. He
had forgotten all about Brother Gulielmus, and
only because he caught his foot on the edge of the
path that curved outwards by the tombstone did
he pause there for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But once stayed, he glanced from habit at the
familiar resting-place of that Gulielmus who had
once been plain Will Ford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over fifty years. And the Vicar before Andy
had been fifty years as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That half-century stretched out, interminable,
before the young man’s vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was the good of a life like that? Why
had he ever become a parson? It was no career
for an active man in the flush of youth and energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was too late now to change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suddenly realised that his arm hurt intensely
after his climb on the ivy, and that he was very
tired, and he sat down on the edge of the tombstone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the dark hour before dawn now, and the
stars were setting. Andy and plain Will Ford—not
Gulielmus—seemed to be very alone and very
near together in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as if the young had crept to the old,
crying—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever feel like this? How did <span class='it'>you</span>
fight through it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the first cock crowed to herald in the
morning, and it seemed almost like an echo of
the sane and jolly laughter of Will Ford, now
asleep. A dog barked somewhere—birds began
to chirp—and—it is a strange thing, but true—Andy
heard a voice say to him, so distinctly that
it might have been Will Ford speaking: “Help
the living—comfort the dying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy started—the words did so seem to come
from nowhere—then he remembered that they
came from somewhere very near indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His work was to help the living, to comfort
the dying”—so ran, in Latin, the inscription on
the tombstone, where Andy sat. And then he
realised, of course, what most of us have done at
one time or another, that an inward voice says
things to us which seem to come from nowhere,
and are arrestingly true, though they are but the
echo of something we have heard before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And by the way in which life turns sometimes
on one of those echoes we get a glimpse—a vague
glimpse, all shadowy—of how echoes from this
existence may influence our souls in the next: we
hold our breath in the face of what seems, then,
to open out before us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy did, anyway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked down at the tomb of a man forgotten,
whom nobody had thought about for a couple
of hundred years, and he knew that not only are
there no private black eyes in the immediate present,
but that they influence eternity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt very small, did Andy, as he trudged
back to the house in the growing morning; but
when the immense truths come quite near to us
we all feel little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he reached the door, an odour of burning
reached him, floating at first almost impalpable
in the sweet air, though definite enough when
it had once been perceived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood quite still for a second, then he began
to run quickly towards the lane, and in the direction
of Mrs. Simpson’s cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tore along, forgetful of his aching arm, and
with a horrible picture of Sally and Jimmy being
burned to death before his mind’s eye. As he
ran, he planned rapidly what he should do in case
the front door were locked and the sleeping Mrs.
Simpson still unconscious of danger, and with his
heart thumping against his side, he raced round
the corner to see Mrs. Simpson seated calmly on a
garden seat in a print dress and silk mantle, with
the two children in woollen rugs and antimacassars
beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy was ill, so the run and the odd revulsion
of feeling left him rather faint and breathless. He
sat down on the end of the garden seat with the
rest, unable to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, really, it was an odd sight if any one had
been there to see. Andy in crushed and crumpled
evening dress, with his hair in a curly bush on his
forehead, staring wildly at Mrs. Simpson, while
Sally’s anxious little face between them was turned
first to one and then the other; while the boy
tried to kick the leg of the seat with his bare feet
and shouted—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me my boots! I want my boots!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s out,” said Mrs. Simpson placidly, in response
to Andy’s appearance, which seemed to
demand something. “The partition between the
two rooms caught fire from the back of the stove.
They never ought to have put one in there. We
might all have been burnt to death in our beds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy wiped his damp forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure it is quite extinguished?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes. The clothes were in soak, so I had
water all handy. It seems as if it was meant.
They’ll have to either take the partition away or
build it up, new. So I shall get it taken away.
Then I can have my sideboard back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stared in a muddled sort of way, first at
Mrs. Simpson and then at the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said. “Oh yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Simpson’s face quickened to anxiety at
last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course—if you don’t feel you can part
with it——” she began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of course I can. It’s yours,” said Andy
eagerly. “I want you to have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Simpson heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” she said. “Well, I think
we may be going in now.” She glanced down at
her toilet. “I just snatched up my widow’s mantle—I
knew I should never get another.” Then
something, strange in Andy’s attire did seem to
strike her. “I expect you were on your way
home from a party,” she said. She paused, considered
the hour, and added: “A ball, I s’pose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N—no,” said Andy. “Only a dinner party.
But I took a walk in the churchyard afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It sounded lame, and Andy was conscious, as
the words died on his lips, that it had so sounded.
“I’m a tremendous person for fresh air,” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Simpson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was all she did say—then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must be going,” said Andy, using the
formula which no parson ever escapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Simpson held out her hand, and glanced at
her apparel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll excuse me rising,” she said, “but I—er—can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Andy hastily, seeking refuge
behind a clerical distance of manner. “Good-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the dawn was rising so glorious over the
odd little group that he was moved to add impulsively—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am thankful you’re all right, Mrs. Simpson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And something in the kind, boyish face under
the upstanding mop of hair may have stirred Mrs.
Simpson, for she said, in the queer tone she always
used coming down the aisle in church—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I prayed that some way might be found for
me to have the sideboard. And now one’s been
found. You never know how Providence is going
to help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy opened his mouth to explain that Providence
does not set fire to some one else’s property
to provide a tenant with space for a sideboard,
when he saw Sally’s eager face looking up
at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The senior curate would have been able to explain
without hurting anything, no doubt, but
Andy was afraid to try.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never do know,” was all he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went home through the freshness of
the early morning, and managed to open the door
with his latch-key, unheard by Mrs. Jebb. It was
a fortunate thing that he had forgotten to bolt it
after him the night before, because his arm was
now so painful that he would have found it impossible
to climb up the ivy to his window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slept late, in spite of the pain, for he was
worn out, and after a poor attempt at a midday
meal he was sitting at tea in the dining-room
when Sam Petch chanced to go past the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The no-butter rule still held good, but Andy
was no anchorite, and generally mitigated the dryness
of his bread with jam or marmalade. This
evening, however, his stomach turned against
plum jam, and he sat listlessly gnawing a piece of
dry bread when Sam Petch glanced in at the
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam stood quite still for a moment, then put
down his spade and rake, and crept on the short
grass to the side of the window, where, by craning
his neck, he could see without being seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood there watching for a few minutes,
then suddenly turned away, and began to run fast
across the grass in the direction of his cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five minutes later, Andy was rising from the
tea-table, when Sam Petch burst panting into the
room with a plate of butter in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” he said; “take it. Butter your bread
on both sides with it. And I’m durned if I touch
another drop o’ beer until further notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy looked at Sam, and he understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Sam,” he said. But a great
deal more than that passed unspoken between
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a bit now,” said Sam, nervously anxious
to avoid comment, though he usually welcomed it.
“Here! Butter a bit and try!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy buttered and ate a piece of bread,
while Sam stood over him, watching every mouthful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delicious butter. Where do you get it?”
said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Will Werrit’s. She’s a rare hand for
butter-making,” answered Sam. “Well, I’ll get
home to my tea. Good afternoon, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, Sam,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the two men parted on those words
their souls drew quite near and said: “We are
brothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course men’s lips are always saying that—but
when two souls say it there is joy in heaven,
because the day for which all creation strives is
just so much the nearer.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Andy</span> was young and strong, so a good night’s
rest and a little attention from the Millsby doctor
soon put his arm sufficiently right to permit of
his going about as usual. A few days later, therefore,
he was quite able to escort his aunt and
cousins to luncheon at the Stamfords’, whence they
were to motor over to a garden-party at the Attertons’
in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no one can be hurt in their vanity by a
wound from which it will never recover sufficiently
to grow strong again, without showing some signs
of stress. And when to this is added a never-ceasing
ache of suspense about the attitude of the
Beloved, there is no doubt that the first chubby,
careless look of youth is bound to vanish. The
aunt and cousins found to their surprise that Andy
was, after all, really grown up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But enough boyishness remained to make him
feel highly delighted, in spite of everything, at
the prospect of showing the girls to his new
friends, and his new friends to them. He was unfeignedly
proud, too, of Mrs. Dixon and her
smart appearance; even, vaguely, of the blue powder,
which had seemed to him from earliest youth
a sort of symbol of discreet dashingness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt and cousins—Mrs. Stamford,” he
said, with such a pleasant triumph in presenting
people sure to accord to each other, that only a
heart of stone could have failed to respond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stamford, however, possessed that heart,
socially; but she was so anxious to be agreeable
to Andy’s relatives that she said with cordiality—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so glad you were able to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the same, the stockings of the young ladies
had a horrible fascination for her: she had never
before realised that stockings could, as it were,
so fill the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to Dick Stamford, who entered as luncheon
was announced, they were a delightful and yet
familiar surprise. He had known stockings to
fill the horizon before, and the general impression
which the Webster girls gave, and Phyllis in particular,
of having more eyes and hair and neck
than other people, created an atmosphere in which
he was absolutely at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mrs. Stamford was so pleased to see Dick
roused from the rather sullen lethargy which was
becoming habitual with him, that she began to see
the Webster girls in a pleasant light too, in spite
of the fact that they outraged all her inherent
prejudices every minute. And yet she was a
woman of strong character. But it is upon the
strongest that mother-love works such ironic miracles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really,” said Mrs. Dixon, seating herself
at table in the beautiful old dining-room, with a
feeling that here—in places like this—was where
she and the girls belonged, “really, I must describe
the tapestry in your hall to Lady Jones.
Lady Jones is a friend of mine whose husband has
just bought an estate—almost <span class='it'>fabulously</span> wealthy,
or seems so to a poor woman who can only just
afford to live.” And she gave her bangles and
her expensive gown a sort of quivering movement
to indicate, with subtlety, that the circles were
indeed wealthy where she could be considered
poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The tapestry? Oh, my husband could tell
you all about that, but, unfortunately, he is not
well to-day, and obliged to remain in his room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said to Lady Jones when she consulted me
about her house, ‘Old masters in the hall, of
course. But I see now I made a mistake. I shall
now advise tapestry <span class='it'>exactly</span> like yours.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid,” said Mrs. Stamford with a suspicion
of dryness, “that Lady Jones will have
rather a job to find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Dixon glanced at Mrs. Stamford’s coat
and skirt, which bore obvious signs of wear, and
at the exquisitely fine linen tablecloth, which was
darned in three places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” she said. “You don’t seem to
care very much for the tapestry, and I know if I
just advise Lady Jones, she will be ready to give
anything—<span class='it'>anything</span>. Now—can I? I should be
<span class='it'>so</span> pleased. I know what agricultural depression
is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned back, feeling nothing could ever be
more delicately done, but Mrs. Stamford paused,
fork in mid-air, and stared at her guest with an
expression that roused her son’s sense of the
ridiculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha-ha!” he laughed. “That’s good! Ask
the mater to sell her nose while you are doing,
Mrs. Dixon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it was only a suggestion,” said Mrs.
Dixon, sailing over the difficulty, and thinking it
highly probable that Mrs. Stamford would come
to her afterwards about the offer, in order to ask
her to use her influence with Lady Jones. The
power of the local millionaire does naturally appear
illimitable in these days of the higher
thought, when everybody is growing able to understand
it. It seems odd to think that only a
hundred years or so ago people believed there
were things more valuable than money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy was engrossed in youthful reminiscences
with Irene, so he did not hear the whole conversation
between his aunt and his hostess, and now
broke in with a genial—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very jolly part where my aunt lives. Always
something going on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people say we give ourselves airs at
Barkham—but we don’t, really. Only it’s impossible
to know everybody who wants to know you,
isn’t it?” said Irene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” continued Phyllis, who was rather excited
at the way in which she was getting on with
a smart man about town such as Dick appeared
to be. “I’ve heard it said <span class='it'>I</span> was ‘sidey.’ Now
you could hardly believe that, could you, Mr.
Stamford?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Stamford bent towards her, and, under
cover of some general conversation about the
garden-party to which they were all going, he
murmured in her ear—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t believe anything about you that
wasn’t most awfully nice, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last young lady to whom Dick said that,
had replied loudly with a push, “Get along with
you!” Phyllis translated this into a whispered
“Oh! I’ve heard that old tale before!” which
did just as well, and held that same pleasant,
beckoning intention which Dick called vaguely,
in his own mind, “Having no nonsense about
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the fruit furnished a topic to Mrs. Dixon,
who described the strawberries she had eaten in
February at the table of Sir Henry and Lady
Jones, and Andy said he hated fruit out of season,
which his aunt thought stupid when it was
so fashionable—she resolved to speak to him
about it afterwards; and finally the whole party
went out into the gardens to await the arrival
of the motor which was to take them to the Attertons’
garden-party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speculation was rife in Mrs. Dixon’s mind during
that interval. She began to feel, somehow,
that Mrs. Stamford could have a silk-lined dress
trimmed with lace, too, if she wanted it—and yet
she wore that blouse! Could it be considered
more aristocratic in county society to go to a party
in loose rags than in a tight and expensive toilet?
If so, she and the girls would <span class='it'>get</span> rags. They
had climbed into the Jones’ set from an obscure
company of poorish merchants and professional
people by showing themselves equal to any society,
and they would continue to follow out the
same successful principles without regard to personal
feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as Mrs. Dixon glanced at her hostess, and
pictured her own carefully repressed figure in that
coat and skirt, she did feel that what you have to
throw away in climbing is almost as painful as
what you have to take on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relief therefore was rather great when
Mrs. Stamford remarked casually—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not going to the Attertons’ this afternoon;
my husband is so seedy I do not care to
leave him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the big motor ran silently up the drive of
Millsby Hall the four young people inside caught
sight of light dresses and gay flowery hats against
the green lawns and the clear blue of the summer
sky. Life seemed to them all—even to Dick,
fighting the hidden enemy—even to Andy, hasting
to a Tantalus feast—to be a sunny, flowery time
of youth and pleasure. Then a gust of wind
brought the sound of a band in the distance playing
an inspiriting march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on—you’re sure to win—Life was made
for such as you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was what the sunshine and the music and
the swift, exhilarating movement of the car cried
out to Andy, almost in words. And he looked
so noticeably young and full of eager hope in spite
of, or perhaps because of, the signs of strain
round his mouth and eyes, that Mrs. Atterton
was moved to remark—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> a glorious day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not mean only that, of course; what her
mind said to Andy’s was, “I see you are finding
life glorious. How very nice!” But no pleasant,
normal person spoils such things by putting
them into words. And Andy understood, though
he did not know he did, any more than she knew
that her mind had spoken to his mind through
the gay bustle and the sunshine of that greeting.
He would learn to see later, would Andy, the fun
and beauty to be found in unspoken conversations—so
far he only felt it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am obliged to receive my guests seated,”
apologised Mrs. Atterton, shaking hands with
Mrs. Dixon and the girls. “My back—” she
smiled the smile she always wore when referring
to that part of her person, cheerful and yet obviously
brave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How sad! I know a lady who never put her
foot to the ground for three years from the same
cause,” said Mrs. Dixon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I have my family to think of,” sighed
Mrs. Atterton, whose back was not to be outdone
by any stranger’s. “No one knows the
effort——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How splendid of you,” said Phyllis. “I do
admire pluck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To give a large party in your state of health—awfully
unselfish,” murmured Irene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they all passed on, and Mrs. Atterton
remarked to her daughter Norah that Mr.
Deane’s relations seemed very good-hearted, kind
people. She was glad, because she liked Mr.
Deane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t like those eyes and those stockings
in the family though, would you?” said
Norah, looking after the young ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In our family?” said Mrs. Atterton. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose if Elizabeth were to marry
Mr. Deane they would be in our family, in a way,
wouldn’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth—Mr. Deane—how ridic——” began
Mrs. Atterton, when a new batch of visitors
came up. But when they also had gone on into
the gardens she said uneasily—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norah, where is Elizabeth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s all right just now—she is over there
shepherding the two old Miss Birketts—and they
are such clingers that she won’t get away
from them for some time. You can always
tell a clinger at a party—they’re so afraid of
losing you for fear they don’t get any one
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Atterton’s jolly face grew even pleasanter
than usual, and she looked extraordinarily like
her daughter Elizabeth, in spite of her huge bulk,
as she replied—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How <span class='it'>awful</span> not to be sure you are wanted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah glanced in the direction of her sister,
who sat between two elderly ladies on a long
seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awful to care about being wanted as much
as Elizabeth does.” She paused, her keen, lovely
little face and slim, erect figure outlined clearly
against the green lawn. “It’s dangerous,” she
added. “She’d far rather be with a dull person
who wanted her badly than the most brilliant
one who was indifferent. It’s a fault in her character.
I’ve always felt it, even when we were at
school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood frowning, speaking more to herself
than to her mother; her strong affection for her
sister, of which neither ever spoke, making her
uneasy and alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth has not a weak character,” said
Mrs. Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—she’s strong—with a weak spot—that’s
worse,” answered Norah, still more to herself
than to her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t move her when she has once made
up her mind,” pursued Mrs. Atterton vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the worst of all,” said Norah. “However”—she
shrugged her shoulders—“life is apt
to get muddled whether you’re clever or not. Oh,
here’s father with the Mayor and Mayoress of
Marshaven and party. He’s happy, anyway.
The Marshaven Corporation is his toy. <span class='it'>How</span> is
it all men have to have a toy? Women
don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why so many of them can’t get there,”
said Mrs. Atterton, who knew perfectly well
what she meant. But Norah, not unnaturally,
thought her mother was talking nonsense again,
sweet old dear, and asked if she should fetch her
a cup of tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy meantime had deposited his aunt with
Miss Banks, daughter of the Vicar of Millsby,
while Dick Stamford after seeing that Elizabeth
was not available had taken the Dixon girls to
see the greenhouses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear boy—like a son to me—and my girls
are devoted to him, though he is no blood relations,”
purred Mrs. Dixon to Miss Banks as they
watched the young Vicar of Gaythorpe stroll
across the grass towards the tennis courts. “So
delighted to find him in such a pleasant neighbourhood.
We have just been lunching with the
Stamfords. I was glad to have the opportunity
of getting a few hints for the furnishing of a
place that a friend of mine, Lady Jones, has
taken. I made,” she creaked towards Miss
Banks with confidential importance, “I don’t
mind telling you that I made a tentative offer for
the tapestries. Nothing settled, of course. But
I know how most of these old county families are
situated nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The tapestries at Gaythorpe?” gasped Miss
Banks, in much the same tone as if Mrs. Dixon
had proposed purchasing Westminster Abbey.
“You made an offer for the Gaythorpe tapestries?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for myself,” said Mrs. Dixon, with
proud humility, waving a tight white glove. “We
are <span class='it'>quite</span> poor people. But to Lady Jones money
is no object. And we are like sisters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How nice!” murmured Miss Banks vaguely,
quite out of her bearings. “Oh, here are the
Miss Birketts coming across to speak to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my nephew is joining Miss Elizabeth,”
said Mrs. Dixon, putting up her eyeglasses.
“Sweet girl! We met her at Marshaven. She
was staying somewhere with an aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” said Miss Banks, glancing at Mrs.
Dixon’s tight fringe, and reflecting on the passing
vision of Phyllis and Irene. They were all new
to the county, and they wore and did the very
things which had been repressed in her from the
moment she left school lest she should be cast out
from the charmed circle, and yet they were intimately
in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Banks accepted an ice and gave the puzzle
up, just at the moment when Andy was shaking
hands with Elizabeth in the green distance beneath
the mulberry trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sorry to miss you that day you called
upon my aunt,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s heart began to thump. What had he
not meant to say that morning? And yet here
he stood—a stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It turned out very wet,” he answered, glancing
at his boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you were driving—that was better than
being on a bicycle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Andy knew she had taken the trouble
to inquire how he came, and the blood rushed up
into his forehead. It was awfully hard, but he
had said he would play fair, and he would keep
his promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you out in the storm?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we came back after it was over,” responded
Elizabeth, whose manner began to
change almost imperceptibly. “Well, I must go
and help Norah with the other guests, I think,”
she added in her soft, slow voice, and she began
to move away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had not been able quite to control that
voice, which would catch on a deep note sometimes,
just when she most wished to keep it even;
and at the sound for which Andy’s heart unconsciously
waited something rose up in him which
belonged to the great powers of existence—strong
to sweep a man off his feet, and down a current
against which he strives with all his might. He
had meant to keep his promise—he had done his
best—but this was stronger than his will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when we have wanted to do our best, it is
a fact that something outside of us often does
intervene to help us when we fail—though nobody
could possibly recognise anything supernatural
in the intervention. Anyway, nothing
could be less like a divine messenger than Lady
Jones in blue and gold, who came round the end
of the mulberry avenue with Mr. Atterton and
the Mayor and Mayoress of Marshaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter Elizabeth—Lady Jones,” said
Mr. Atterton, who was in high feather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Jones came to open a bazaar for a
former curate of the church she attends at home,”
explained the Mayoress. “We took the liberty
of asking for an invitation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very ’appy to be of any service to the town,”
said Lady Jones with ineffable aplomb and condescension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Jones bought most of the big things,
including the screen your aunt sent, Miss Elizabeth,”
said the Mayor effusively. He was a decent
man, but you have to be effusive to millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you like the embroidery—my aunt
spent months over it,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which was it? Oh, the cockatoos? Very
nice, I’m sure. But I just pass the things on,
on mass, to another bazaar. I don’t buy what
I want for the Towers at bazaars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” murmured the Mayoress.
“Maple’s, more likely, or Christy’s——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lovely things at Christy’s,” agreed Mr. Atterton,
who also saw, not a fat, rather vulgar woman,
but a heap of money which had shed some of
its particles to forward an object which he had
at heart, and could shed more at will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Andy came forward—it had taken him
the few moments to recover his self-control—and
the great lady shook hands with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to hear you’ve got a living,” she said.
“But I always told your aunt it was a pity you
would be a parson. Never a penny to bless themselves
with—and begging all round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m satisfied,” said Andy, with a grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Jones smiled affably back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you be satisfied if you are poor?”
she said. “Nobody could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poverty isn’t always a question of money,”
said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha-ha!” laughed Lady Jones. “I see your
daughter’s young yet, Mr. Atterton. She hasn’t
learned that everything’s a question of money.
You and me knows that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We does,” agreed Mr. Atterton, involuntarily
following the lady’s lead; then he recollected
himself, gave a quick glance round, and added,
in some haste, “Of course, money is a power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt is there, under those trees,” said
Andy, covering the retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Dixon!” exclaimed Lady Jones, for
some vague reason rather annoyed to find that
lady even with her here too. “How did <span class='it'>she</span> get
invited? Oh, came with you, Mr. Deane, of
course.” And suddenly the county society round
Gaythorpe seemed less select in her eyes, as she
walked up to the bench in the shade where her
friend and Miss Banks were sitting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—’ow are <span class='it'>you</span>, my dear?” she called
across a space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Dixon jumped up, creaking in every
whalebone, and, after a moment’s breathless
pause, rustled forward with her most fashionable
air of greeting—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charmed to meet you here, Lady Jones.
How very fortunate—but how unforeseen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Jones has been kind enough to help
us most generously with the bazaar for the new
chancel,” explained Mr. Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Came to us for the opening ceremony, and
remained the night,” added the Mayor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Dixon’s prominent grey eyes glanced
swiftly round the group, and returned to the face
of her friend. It was all right then. But she
might have known. You had only got to be rich
enough. She went nearer, and slipped her hand
through the blue and gold arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How lovely to see you again. I was talking
of you at luncheon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go and have tea?” said Mr. Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the whole group went into the house, Elizabeth
and Andy being the last to cross the wide
terrace before the open French windows; but
just as they were about to enter, Elizabeth
paused, and said to her companion in a careless
voice—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How hot and crowded it looks in there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face was turned towards the house, and
rather away from Andy, so that he could not see
the colour deepening in the creamy bloom of her
cheeks, or how her golden eyes shone with changing
lights, or how the tendrils of hair which the
sun caught became pure gold to crown this golden
girl; but his heart knew that she was giving the
woman’s eternal invitation, and it was very hard—so
hard, that his own face became aged and
sharpened—to answer as he did—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s a big room. I don’t suppose we shall
feel the heat much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Elizabeth felt as if some one had
struck her a sudden blow, because what lay under
those words was the unspoken “No,” which is
the most bitter thing the heart of a woman can
ever hear. The spoken “No” can never bring
quite such bitterness, because the woman who
could force that would not feel so shamed by the
refusal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she brought all her girl’s pride to her
aid, and looked him, laughing, in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did not suppose I wanted to stay outside,
and go without my tea, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-no,” said Andy. The ages have not taught
men to hide as they have taught women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ravenous,” said Elizabeth, speaking more
quickly than usual; then, with a bright colour in
her cheeks and a fire in her eyes, she ran into the
room where Dick Stamford was administering
tea to the Misses Webster. He glanced at her,
casually at first, and afterwards with roused attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Elizabeth,” he took occasion to whisper,
“you do look stunning in that lilac gown.
You make all the other women look—look
tough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I’m tough enough,” said poor
Elizabeth ruefully. “Girls have got to be.” But
the remark acted as a sort of safety-valve to her
seething anger and shamed resentment, so that
she was able to keep back her tears, and laugh
and joke, with eyes only the more brilliant for
them, amongst the group of young people who
gathered round her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Webster girls being thus left without a
cavalier, Andy sat down beside them, and tried
to respond to a stream of conversation while he
watched Elizabeth and wondered miserably if
he had been a conceited ass to think she meant
anything. He came to the conclusion that he
must have made a mistake as he saw her take a
large cake with cream inside and chocolate out,
for his own soul loathed even bread and butter
at this moment, though he had felt hungry half
an hour earlier, and he was very fond of cakes
with cream in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lovely day,” he said, trying to rouse himself
with an effort that would have been obvious to the
Webster girls if their minds had been sufficiently
composed to notice his manner. But they were
so engaged in glancing self-consciously about
them, and wondering what people thought of
them, that they also made perfunctory remarks
with no particular connection between one and
the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Mrs. Dixon rustled up, looking to
Andy’s loyal eyes extremely smart still, in spite of
the fact that her nose was no longer so calmly,
palely blue as when she arrived. And when she
parted from her nephew over the side of the
hired motor vehicle which was to take her and her
daughters back to Marshaven, he felt no less
than she did that her final remark, “We’re so
glad, Andy, to be able to come among your
friends and give you a little help socially,” was as
just as it was generous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awfully good of you. I knew you and the
girls were certain to get on with the people about
here,” he said gratefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moisture almost appeared in Mrs. Dixon’s
prominent eyes, and her nose-end flushed unmistakably;
she had taken a liqueur before leaving,
and was more emotional than usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brilliantine your hair and always wear a good
hat,” she said earnestly, “and you may end by
being a bishop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the car went off, and the embryo bishop
trudged home through the afternoon sun, trying
to piece his thoughts together, and conscious of a
burning, stinging spot in the back of his mind that
he was afraid to touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it drew—as the aching spot always does—and
he got to it at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Lady Jones had not appeared when she did
he would have broken his promise to Dick Stamford.
Instead of helping a weak man, he would
have proved himself to be a weaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With bent head and dragging feet he trudged
up the churchyard path. Here—he felt it in the
bottom of his soul—here, but for the grace of
God, went a breaker of promises—a sneak—a
man who couldn’t play fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have to keep away from Elizabeth,
because he could no longer trust himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mechanically glanced at the church clock,
and saw there was still a quarter of an hour before
the time for evensong, and he suddenly realised
that he was dog-tired. So he sat down,
more from force of habit than anything else, upon
the convenient edge of the tombstone beneath
which Brother Gulielmus’ body lay resting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after a while a little comfort crept into
poor Andy’s soul from somewhere, and he began
to lose that impression of loneliness which to
some natures is so intensely real and desolate.
He began to have a sense of brotherhood with all
those who have tried and nearly failed and not
quite failed through no goodness of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so he felt a brother to all men—for every
one of us must pass that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, he got up from the tombstone and
walked towards the church, and round the corner
of the porch he heard the voices of two women
near a grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Churchyard grass wants cutting,” said one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the parson’ll see to it,” said the other.
“He does look after the bit there is to do, does
Parson Andy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the poor lad went in, comforted still further
by the warm, motherly note in the woman’s
voice as she said ‘Parson Andy.’ He had come
down low enough—or gone up high enough—to
be grateful that the people of Gaythorpe called
him ‘Parson Andy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the same time Elizabeth and Norah
Atterton went across the lawn towards the house
in order to dress for dinner. Some of the guests
had stayed, so there was not much time, but
Norah had something to say, and when she had
something to say she said it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Deane females were quaint,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are called Dixon and Webster,” replied
Elizabeth—but it must be owned that a great deal
more was said than the words indicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Lady Jones a daughter? If so, Mr.
Deane really ought——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How vulgar you can be,” said Elizabeth.
“You talk as if Mr. Deane were a mere fortune-hunter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he is,” said Norah calmly. “All
clergymen are. They have to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth said nothing for a few steps, then
she remarked rather abruptly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he is not what you’d call an eager hunter,
exactly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah stopped dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean to tell me he hasn’t proposed
to you? We were all sure he had done, and that
you were now behaving to him like a sister.” She
broke off, and looked at her sister with her odd,
mocking little smile. “That would be so exactly
like you, Elizabeth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has not proposed to me—if that is what
you want to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How odd!” said Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why odd?” said Elizabeth, with some pardonable
asperity. “I don’t expect every young
man I meet to propose to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” said Norah. “And now he
has these girls within reach, I expect he will not
be always making excuses to come over here. I
dare say he was dull, and no wonder. And after
all, you are not so unused to admiration that you
would feel the loss of one young man, would you?
Even if he did prove faithless?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I can exist without Mr. Deane, if that
is what you mean,” said Elizabeth, marching on
with her head in the air.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Andy</span> still went up to Gaythorpe Manor fairly
often to play billiards with Dick Stamford; but
the two young men no longer sat chatting after
their game, and their talk became rather strained,
as it always must be between two people who are
constantly reminded by each other’s presence of a
subject about which they cannot speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact is that the air becomes, under those
circumstances, so full of interesting and unspoken
conversations that you cannot hear the dull words
which do pass, and when Andy said, “Rotten
weather for the time of year,” he really was indicating
the unpleasantness of life in the present trying
conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when Dick Stamford replied, “Yes,
beastly,” he meant that Andy was not the only one
who suffered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a young clergyman who dashes about the
country in a shining green cart picked out with red
drawn by a very active piebald pony does not
excite pity in the casual observer, and people
round Gaythorpe, and in all the villages between
there and Marshaven, where Mrs. Dixon and the
Webster girls still lingered, said to each other
that Parson Andy had the times of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way Elizabeth was able to see very
plainly that he did not wear the willow; and
Norah, who was greatly relieved to find that her
sister would not be thrown away on an impecunious
country clergyman, lost no opportunity of accentuating
this obvious fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the summer days passed on into autumn,
Elizabeth was obliged to own to herself that she
had given the most exquisite thing a girl has to
give—first love, with all the bloom and glory on
it—to a man who had looked at it quite near and
not found it worth taking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not mope or grow thin, but she looked
sometimes as if she had not slept, and her mother
made her take some kind of beef juice. Beef
juice invariably is administered by those in authority
for disappointed love, though they may
know nothing about the love, and Elizabeth took
it because she did not want to talk about her
symptoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had some silent hours which left a mark
on her life before she finally made up her mind
that Andy did not want her; and she quite haunted
the doorstep of the Miss Birketts, who were very
dull, and lived in a little house in Millsby, and
always had dry cakes, and wanted her very much
indeed. She clung at this time with a sort of still
passion to those who wanted her enough. Outwardly,
however, she was just the same. Her
slow voice, and her manner, which was like that of
a young mother and yet all girlish, did not change
at all. The peculiar, elusive tenderness of it only
deepened; there was a sort of strength in sweetness
about Elizabeth now which you may often
notice in those who love so much that they will be
bound to sacrifice—the sort of thing which lies
at the bottom of all the folly and all the glory of
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning she came down to breakfast when
a rather celebrated amateur ornithologist was
staying with her parents, and, Mrs. Atterton for
once being present at that meal, the conversation
fell on parrots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that’s the worst of love—there are such
ordinary topics which it endows with the power
to sting—even poll-parrots, for instance. Elizabeth
thought of that moment in Sam Petch’s
kitchen when the gates of the Enchanted Muddle
shone near and splendid before her happy eyes,
and felt she could not bear it. Yet she also felt
that she loved the deceiving bird about whose obstinately
silent head shone the glory of that time
when she and Andy had laughed together. She
could not have it branded as an impostor and
turned out into the cold world of cheap bird-fanciers’
windows. And that was what seemed
about to happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be so grateful if you will drive over
with me and look at a valued parrot which belonged
to my poor aunt,” said Mrs. Atterton.
“I feel I have neglected my duty—but my
back——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” bowed the celebrated ornithologist,
paying the deference due. “No one could
expect——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Especially,” said Mrs. Atterton, “one who
now understands everything. There were times
on earth when she did not quite appreciate, poor
dear, how I suffered. But,” she added, “that
makes me all the more anxious to look after the
parrot, if you understand? And the poor bird
has changed so. Lost its voice and its—its wonderful
assertiveness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha-ha! that’s what you call it, do you?”
laughed Mr. Atterton. “Most ill-tempered, ugly
old bird! Those poor Petches must have been
more than thankful when it lost its voice. Enough
to drive you into a lunatic asylum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth felt profoundly thankful that Norah
was away and had never been moved to investigate
the parrot problem, for she recognised that
danger was in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure Mr. Parrish gets enough birds at
home. Besides, he only goes in for stuffed ones,”
she interposed hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were all alive once, my dear young
lady,” said Mr. Parrish, smiling on Elizabeth,
whom he liked because she did not seem very
clever. He was of those who prefer to hold all
the cards in their own hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course; how silly of me,” said Elizabeth,
with a meek little laugh. The best of women
will understand how, though they may not
own it. “I had been thinking of asking you to
walk through the woods with me—I know
hardly anything about birds, and there are so
many in Millsby woods—but, of course, you
would prefer to drive with mamma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eminent ornithologist was also a man, and
he was torn between an intense desire to walk
through the woods instructing this sweet and
teachable young lady, and politeness to his hostess.
Happily Mrs. Atterton herself solved the
difficulty by saying, with a sigh of relief—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that’s delightful! I really did not feel
quite equal to the drive, but I was anxious for you
to see poor William.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was owing to this conversation that, two
hours later, Andy encountered the couple in the
wood, or rather followed them for a brief distance
down one of the cross-roads; and he could
not help being struck—no one could—by the efforts
Elizabeth was making to please her companion.
He had still hoped in the very depths of
his mind that she might be pining for him, as he
was for her; but now he saw that she could be
engrossed in another fellow without even feeling
that he was only fifty yards away from her. He
decided that if she had ever loved him she must
have felt that he was near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he turned dejectedly down the next opening
without making his presence known, and could
not know that Elizabeth was fascinating against
time, which is, really, no such pleasing occupation,
though an engrossing one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, however, the habits of a lifetime asserted
themselves and the ornithologist looked at
his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Miss Elizabeth”—that shows how
far he had got—“<span class='it'>do</span> you know it is nearly one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” said the deceitful Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear,” said the gentleman, very much
worried, “that I shall now not have time to
see the parrot. My train leaves at two-fifteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it really?” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have stayed on, but I have an important
meeting to-night,” he continued, pushing
his hat up from his forehead. “But”—he relaxed
into an affectionate smile—“I shall hope
to come again soon—very soon. I shall explain
that to Mrs. Atterton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall have to hurry frightfully if we are
to be back in time,” said Elizabeth, suiting the
action to the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust—I may hope—for a welcome—from
you,” panted Mr. Parrish, who was not in such
good walking form as Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she pretended not to hear, and finally
landed a very tired and perspiring ornithologist
at the family luncheon table only three minutes
late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did you think of William?” asked
Mrs. Atterton earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We never saw him. We lost our way in the
wood,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lost your way in Millsby wood!” began Bill,
when a beseeching glance from his sister checked
him, and he added good-naturedly: “Well,
there are a lot of—er—rum turnings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only about five minutes afterwards the bottled-in
chuckle suddenly exploded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill,” said his mother—his father was away—“Bill,
what are you laughing at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth’s bump of locality,” responded
that youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing amusing in that,” said Mrs.
Atterton coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, mother,” said Bill, with unusual meekness,
and Mrs. Atterton could not think why her
daughter turned so red. She hoped there was
nothing going on between Elizabeth and the
ornithologist, because he lived nearly all the year
abroad, and she did want this home-girl of hers
to remain near home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after lunch Bill did remark to his sister—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say—I don’t want a stuffed owl for a
brother-in-law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s no worse,” retorted the goaded Elizabeth,
“than having a live donkey for a brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she retired to her room, and Bill went out
with a grin to exercise the dogs.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>There is a theory held by many wise people
that if we were all happy we should all be good
and clever; but facts at present do seem rather to
dispute it. For instance, Andy was undoubtedly
less happy than he had ever been in his life,
though he was beginning to get hold of the meaning
of life, and yet he was both better and
cleverer than when he was happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His soul was learning, awkwardly and timidly,
with many mishaps, to drive his body—and that
is, of course, after all, the reason of human life;
when we have learned that we are ready for the
next thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His air of sane and jolly boyishness was just
the same, but strength showed through it; you
saw that he might grow into one of those sane and
jolly men who keep the world from going mad,
but you also saw that if anything went wrong
with the driving-gear he would have a bad fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he sat in his study window the sunlight
filled the garden with that deep radiance peculiar
to an English September afternoon, and he looked
out with a glance more focused, and features
sharper, than on that spring day when he saw it
all in a glory of gold and green. After a while
he straightened his shoulders, as if banishing some
insistent thought, and drew the paper towards
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His little articles were accepted more often
now, and he wrote slowly, so that a good deal of
his spare time was occupied in this way. But he
was learning to follow the Holy Grail of all
writers, which is to find the arresting and beautiful
which hides in the obvious, and those who do
that seek long and never come quite close; but
there is a wonder in the far glimpse they catch
sometimes which makes up for years of pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, those only start on the quest to
whom sorrow has wept and reality spoken, though
a secret joy goes with them all the way which
makes the dullest path a highway of adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy gave up trying to write of the infinities,
and yet they began to shine, somehow,
through the simple things he wrote about common
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He worked on until Sam Petch came back from
his tea and desired an audience, then he put down
his pen and turned to the open door with some
impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Primitives has got our apples,” burst
forth Sam, before he was well inside the room.
“For six years we’ve had the pulpit done with
’em, and the Primitives has been and got the
promise of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let them,” said Andy. “I don’t mind.
We can use something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam struggled to be polite, because he was a
polite man, but he could not keep it out of his
voice that he thought Andy a fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Use something else?” he repeated. “Can’t
you see, sir, what a smack in the face it is for you
and the Church? Strangers come from far and
near to the harvest festival. Everybody in the
parish has somebody to tea for it. As far as Millsby
they come from, and last year I counted no less
than four Bardswell people. And they’ll all say,
‘Where’s the apples?’ For nobody ever saw
such red little apples anywhere. And folks’ll
have to answer back, ‘Primitives has got ’em.’
It’s a slight on you, sir, that’s what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy had not yet learned that this affair,
in Gaythorpe, assumed the same proportions as
the seizing of a burdensome protectorate by a
rival nation, and was as hurtful to the pride of the
vanquished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very good of you to bother about it,” said
Andy, “but I really don’t care a bit. What does
it matter whether we have red flowers with the
corn or red apples?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And after you giving that old f——”—Sam
checked himself—“body a whole ounce of your
own tobacco only last week—it’s outrageous!
But he has a niece stopping with him from Bardswell
that’s a hot Primitive, and there you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor old chap, surely he has a right to do
what he likes with his own apples—he can’t eat
’em, more’s the pity,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can!” retorted Sam. “Anybody can
with a scoop made out of a mutton bone. But
it’s the principle of the thing I hate.” He paused.
“Then you won’t go to see him about it, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not,” said Andy, returning to his
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam closed the door and retreated thoughtfully
down the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning—the day before the harvest
festival—was one of those autumn mornings
when the world seems full of a cool sparkle, and
the sunshine is to summer sunshine as champagne
a little iced is to some still, golden wine which
you drink under heavy-leaved trees at a Spanish
inn. There’s a quality in it that makes the dullest
want to be a little jolly—and those who are jolly
already, like young Sam Petch, feel a little drunk
with the clear exhilaration of it. They are buoyantly
ready for anything, and not to be beaten
even by Fate or nieces who are hot Primitives
safely in possession of a desired object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyway this was how Sam felt as he picked up
Andy’s fallen apples which were only tame green
and yellow, and he meditated, whistling, on the
lovely red clusters which hung in a little garden
at the other end of the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By and by out came Mrs. Jebb, ostensibly to
fetch apples for a pudding, but really for conversation
and fresh air, for she too felt the prickling
stir of this lovely autumn morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam’s eyes lightened and grew younger than
ever under his grizzled mop as he caught sight of
her, and after a moment of that tense quietude in
which men await a growing, fine idea, he slapped
his thigh and muttered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Sam,” said Mrs. Jebb, immensely
condescending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, ’m,” said Sam, humbly respectful,
with an ingenuous air of being grateful
for such a lady’s notice; but his brain was working
like a steam engine. How was he to begin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Fate helped him, as she does, perversely,
such people, while she leaves deserving objects
like you and me severely alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Deane says you may drive me into
Bardswell this morning, if you will. Mrs. Dixon
and the young ladies are coming to supper after
the harvest festival to-morrow night, and there is
no whisky in the house—Mrs. Dixon takes whisky
for her gout—and we want various other little
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many bottles are you to get?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Er—two,” said Mrs. Jebb, whose dignified
coldness intimated that it was no business of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Sam came a little nearer and spoke earnestly
to Mrs. Jebb under the apple tree, and Mrs.
Jebb appeared at first annoyed, then interested,
then righteously indignant, finally in a state of
fluttered adventurousness, for through this stirring,
sparkling day she too was going forth to do
something desperate for the sake of Romance,
and it made her feel agitatedly splendid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Really she was going to give Sam the second
bottle of Andy’s whisky, presuming on the safe
assumption that only one would be required and
that he would forget all about the other. But it
was a reckless and daring deed for one who had
taken through life the motto of her pinafore days:
“It is a sin to steal a pin, and much more so a
greater thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mother had worked that on a sampler and,
incidentally, on Mrs. Jebb’s soul—as mothers did
in the dark days before we all grew too clever to
work samplers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So no wonder that, having so given herself
away to Sam, she should try to take a little back
with a final—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Petch, you will be round punctually at
half-past two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or, that, when she did climb into the cart behind
the frisky piebald, she should remark to her
coachman—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Jebb always maintained that the sign
of success was the ability to take a cab without
consideration, and for weeks together I never so
much as crossed the street on foot. Now I consider
<span class='it'>this</span> luxury. Other times, other manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so, Mrs. Jebb,” agreed Sam, with respectful
heartiness, though he had no idea what
she was driving at. “Gee-up, Tommy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cart gave a slight lurch, and for a moment
Mrs. Jebb clung to her hat, which was of the airy,
summery kind which some women always wear
forlornly on into autumn, just as they cling to felt
in a burning June. It is not a question of money
but of temperament. Then they passed a little
garden where an apple tree with the reddest
apples ever seen, deep crimson with ruby streaks
on them, glowed like jewels in the sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s them,” whispered Sam behind his
hand, though there was not a soul in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb averted her eyes and shivered
slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it really would be taken as an
indication by all the villages round that Mr.
Deane was not getting on well with his parishioners?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m certain sure it would,” breathed Sam
earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said Mrs. Jebb, drawing a long
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam glanced at her and hastened to change the
subject from apples to women, with some instinctive
sense of the connection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t get a wife—Mr. Deane doesn’t.
They say Miss Elizabeth Atterton give him the
mitten. I don’t credit it. She seemed keen enough
on him so long as he kept going to see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know anything about it,” said Mrs.
Jebb coldly; then she closed her eyes as if the
light affected them and conversed no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But under her calm exterior a great storm was
going on, and above that storm echoed some
words that her father had read aloud from <span class='it'>David
Copperfield</span>, while they all sewed in the old, old
days in a narrow street of the place where she
was born. “The first fancy of an undisciplined
heart”—that was how the quotation came back,
not quite correctly, of course, to a brain like Mrs.
Jebb’s, but near enough to make her feel another
Agnes, and to dismiss Elizabeth to that sentimental
paradise where foolish girls with light hair
and creamy complexions belong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pictured Andy turning for consolation to a
more mature affection such as an experienced
woman could give, and she was walking down the
church aisle in pale-grey on his arm when Sam
drew up with a jerk at the grocer’s shop, and she
was obliged to come back from all that and order
food. No wonder she forgot the sardines and the
gelatine! Ordinary groceries, of course, were
purchased in Gaythorpe, but these were to have
been part of the supper next night. However,
even when Mrs. Jebb remembered them on the
way home, she still was in an exalted state of
mind which made her feel vaguely that where
love was, all was, and that a sardine more or
less mattered nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was rather rudely shaken out of this blissful
state by Andy’s reception of the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But sardines on toast were to have been the
only hot dish,” he said, “and you can’t get decent
ones in Gaythorpe. Why didn’t you make a
proper list, Mrs. Jebb? You know you have no
memory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it likely I should have a good memory after
all I’ve gone through?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy felt rather ashamed of himself, while
knowing he had no reason to be, and that a man
who orders sardines ought to get them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After tea young Sam Petch watched the little
cottage with its one apple tree now black against
the end of the sunset until the niece, who was a
hot Primitive, had departed to an evening class
at the chapel. He held a bottle concealed beneath
his coat, and every now and then he laid its
cool side affectionately against his face, while he
sniffed at the leaden cap which jealously retained
the fragrance locked within. Once he muttered
something to himself and began to ease the cap,
but with a terrific effort he desisted and put the
bottle resolutely farther away from his thirsty
mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the hot Primitive went out, looking
very cool and self-reliant in neat blue serge, and
Sam knocked at the cottage door just as dusk was
hiding the quiet fields beyond the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remained within for half an hour, while
voices rose and fell, and there were emotional
silences of indecision; then he opened the door
and stood cautiously within, holding a basket in
one hand and a small ladder in the other, while
he looked back for a last word—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll be that mad,” urged an old man’s voice
from the dark interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know what to say,” responded Sam,
curbing his impatience. “Say you’ve always
given the apples to the Church, and when I came
for ’em you couldn’t refuse me. That’s true
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A match was struck, a faint and pleasant
clinking which made Sam’s mouth water came
through the quiet air, but he walked away into
the dewy garden with his ladder and basket. And
as he stood between the cool green world and the
reposeful sky, where faint stars began to glimmer
through the dusk, the poet that hides in almost
every man was stirred a little. He laid the
apples in the basket with the same charmed sense
of adventure that children know when they hear
of the cave of Aladdin and that spirit first awakes
which drives them forth later into the far places
of the earth, whence they bring nothing back but
a secret memory. Young Sam Petch, with his
breeches tied with string, and his grizzled hair,
was gathering, in that moment, the enchanted,
forbidden fruit of every fable since the world began.
The greatest can do no more—a schoolboy
in a wood can do no less—real adventure is so
splendidly democratic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the apples were all gathered, and the
misty twilight had cleared into the soft radiance
of a starlit night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s your ladder,” said Sam, tapping very
cautiously at the cottage door—not that there
was any one to hear save a belated crow, but
the spirit of adventure is always unconsciously
dramatic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man popped out his head into the starlight—he,
too, felt somehow stirred and jolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got ’em?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, every one,” whispered Sam back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For men can always go on being boys playing
at robbers—that’s why they never grow so old as
women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put the ladder back in just the same place,”
chuckled the old man under his breath. “I
don’t want <span class='it'>her</span> to find out till to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you’re not frightened?” said Sam.
“Frightened of a niece?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—course not.” Pause. “You’re not
frightened of anything with a drop of something
warm inside you.” Pause again and a conclusion
of intense bitterness. “Barley water! She keeps
me on barley water!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I know if I’d let myself be frightened
by any w——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faint footsteps in the lane—rapid dispersal—and
when the hot Primitive reached the cottage
all was in darkness and nothing seemed alive but
a smell of whisky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle!” called the hot Primitive. “Come
down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had armed himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t, my dear. Got my trousers off.” And
he repeated the formula about the apples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Sam Petch, then. I might have known,”
cried the indignant niece. “He’s an evil liver and
wants to drag you down to his level.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>His</span> liver’s all right—it’s mine that won’t
work nowadays,” answered the old man at random,
for he was trying his door to see if the lock
really held; then when he found it did, he called
more valiantly, “Good-night. Sleep well, my
dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, uncle,” said the niece, but it did
not seem to mean that; then she flung open the
cottage door and the window where the geraniums
flowered, and thought with pious resignation of
the time when the apples would be inevitably hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Sam tramped between wet, scented
hedges underneath the stars with the big basket
of apples on his arm, but he stopped still every
now and then and muttered something that was
obviously not in tune with the soft quiet of the
September night. He put the apples in a safe
place in the hayloft, and then went straight to
Andy’s study door without the usual preliminaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked white and fagged as he sat over his
papers, as if he were keeping some wearing
thought at bay, which yet made the writing a
great mental strain. It is not easy for a man to
be in love, body and soul, at twenty-six, and yet
to remain away and wait. And Andy had more to
bear than mere waiting, for he began to be torn
by those fears and agonies which seem trivial to
other people but are more real and poignant to
those most concerned than any of the tremendous
things of life which can come afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Sam?” he said, seeing the man through
a haze of ideas that he was forging amid the fire
of his emotions, and only half aware of him.
“What is it now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got the apples. Old Bateson’s given me
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all right,” said Andy, turning back to his
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something else,” said Sam. “I told
you I wouldn’t touch drink again without giving
you notice. Well—this is notice. I’d have a
glass of beer this night if I knew the devil was
waiting to get me when I’d drunk the last drop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mist of thought cleared out of Andy’s
eyes and they became very kind and bright. He
rang the bell without speaking, while Sam
watched him uneasily. And when the little maid
appeared he ordered her to bring in tea in ten
minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want no——” began Sam roughly,
driven beside himself by the old enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you wait ten minutes for me?” asked
Andy. “I won’t ask you to do more than that.
I am going out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t——” began Sam again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right, Sam,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s silence while the two
men looked at each other, then Sam drew a long
breath and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, I’ll wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment after the time stated Andy rushed in
breathless with two bottles under his arm, and
almost upset the little maid, who was carrying the
tea-tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A tumbler, please,” he said, sitting down to
the table. “Here, Sam, you have that chair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam sat gingerly on the edge of it, feeling
suspicious that he was being ‘had,’ and yet
scarcely thinking it of Parson Andy—but parsons
were all alike, evidently, when you got deep
enough down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door closed on the little maid again, the
tumbler stood clean and shining on the table.
Sam’s throat became dry as he stared morosely at
it. Then there was a click, as of a beer-bottle
being opened, the golden fluid ran ‘clop-clop-clop’
into the glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, Sam,” said Andy, holding it out; and
turning to the teapot, he poured himself out a cup
of tea without looking at his visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bit of cake?” he said, holding the plate.
Then he glanced at Sam. “Why, you’re not
drinking the beer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean it, sir?” asked Sam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do. Here’s another bottle when
you’ve finished that. I was glad of somebody to
talk to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My respects,” Sam said, gulping down the
ale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Andy poured out another bottle and
brought forth tobacco, and as they smoked they
talked together about everything on earth. Certain
it is, that Andy had never been so amusing or
so brilliant in his life, and sounds of laughter
could be heard long after eleven in the apartment
where Mrs. Jebb enjoyed her chaste repose, while
the study was misty with tobacco-smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning, however, the little maid came
out of the room aghast, with the two empty beer-bottles
on her tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smoking and drinking till nearly twelve
o’clock with Sam Petch! Why, even the public-house
closes at eleven!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Deane has a perfect right to do as he
likes in his own house without giving rise to foolish
remarks,” said Mrs. Jebb with her lips—but
her heart was so little in it that Sophy felt emboldened
to reply—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does seem queer, ’m.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you get to my age, you will find that
things are not always what they seem,” said Mrs.
Jebb vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she shook her head as she took up the
bottles, and again as she secreted them with her
own fair fingers in the dust-bin.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Frost</span> came in the night and the next morning
was fine and glorious; the aromatic scent of autumn
mingled with that of a brushwood fire in
Mrs. Simpson’s garden, and the smoke of it rose
like incense to the god of harvest, straight up into
a blue sky flecked with white clouds which were
great brooding angels with their faces towards
heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When one man, meeting, said to another, ‘Fine
morning!’ it was a Laus Dei that he meant, and
the crimson beeches glowing upon the green country
were lamps of festival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And something of that splendour which has
fired the souls of men like love and battle caught
hold of Andy as he walked down the lane in the
sunshine. “Oh, all ye works of the Lord—praise
ye the Lord—bless Him and magnify Him for
ever!” He knew how the man felt who wrote
that, and was thrilled with that strange sense of
nearness which men have when they sing a song
together, the words swelling up; but it is not the
words that move them so—it is the sense of having
got a little nearer together in the immense
loneliness of the Universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And some of this brief ecstasy was Andy’s as
he walked towards Mrs. Simpson’s cottage in the
sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the turn he met Jimmy Simpson dragging a
new-painted horse and cart but otherwise unattended,
even by the faithful Sally. His golden curls
shone in the morning sun, and he, too, seemed to
come along in a sort of glory. When he reached
Andy he said nothing, but looked from the piebald
creature to the face high above him in breathless
expectation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a beauty! I never saw such a horse
and cart in my life,” said Andy, who loved children
enough to know what was expected of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The round face relaxed into smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my birfday, Mith Elithabeth broughted
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?” demanded Andy, glancing eagerly
up the lane. “Has she gone home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeth,” said Jimmy. Then he corrected himself,
for he only lisped now in moments of great
excitement. “Yes. She went home d’reckly.
She said her mummy wanted her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy bent down and touched the piebald back
of the animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s like Tommy, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better’n Tommy,” said his owner sturdily.
Then his eyes rounded more widely than ever,
and he remarked—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a funny thing to kith a cart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young gentlemen eyed each other in
the sunny lane, the one curious, the other shamefaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Andy who turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say—let’s fill the cart with hay.” And he
began to cut grass for the purpose with his penknife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the keen, fine morning took on its last glory
because she had passed that way, while he, like
a clod, had been eating bacon, and he kissed the
unpleasant red paint of the cart-wheel because her
fingers must have touched it. For the springtime
of life breeds such follies—or what men call follies
afterwards for fear of regretting them too
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the game of hay-cutting came to an end,
and Jimmy tramped back on his sturdy little legs,
dragging his cart behind him, and as Andy
watched him go safely round the turn, he looked
back and shouted—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better’n Tommy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Jimmy was a Briton of the old type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy went in with his thoughts full of
Elizabeth, and he felt as we all do when we are
young on a prickly sunny morning, that he must
get what he wanted because he wanted it so
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All day long while he helped to decorate the
little bare church and was gay with the young
ladies who assisted, and attentive to Mrs. Thorpe
who brought sheaves of corn and piles of flowers
and fruit over which she presided like a jolly goddess
of plenty in the porch, he was thinking about
Elizabeth. When Mrs. Thorpe said, “Do try
one of these pears, they are so sweet,” he replied
with decorum, but his heart throbbed ridiculously,
“Sweet—sweet—how sweet my lady is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Rose Werrit asked if she should
decorate the pulpit, and was so pleased that old
Bateson had given them the red apples after all,
because they were so bright and pretty—he said,
“Yes, indeed—how good of you,” but even made
a sort of song in his head about that—though,
really, Elizabeth’s worst enemy could never have
called her ‘bright.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Dixon and the Webster girls arrived
about six o’clock, and the whole household
went in to service excepting Phyllis, who felt at
the last moment that she could not stand the
heated church and preferred a quiet walk instead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last of the sunset was dying behind the unstained
windows as the rough, country voices sang
the harvest hymn, but the lamplight fell pleasantly
enough upon grain and fruit and flowers, and as
Andy stood there, though he did not know it, he
was leading his people back to the mystic beginning
of all worship. He joined hands with
Brother Gulielmus, who as plain Will Ford had
sung a song at many a harvest home—and farther
back still, with all those who had ever felt the
joy of harvest. Rooted in immemorial needs—crowned
with a hope that cannot die—belonging
to all men and to all creeds—no wonder the
hymn of that festival floated out across the sleeping
fields with a poignant joy, a desperate hopefulness,
that made old Bateson at his cottage door
remark—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad I let ’em have them apples!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And which, all unconsciously, caused the hot
Primitive to reply—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you did!” It was only afterwards
that she added: “The schoolmaster has arranged
with Mr. Deane that we are to have them for our
pulpit next week. So all’s well that ends well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Bateson glanced at his niece and felt a
little annoyed—like all those who conquer seldom
he objected to having a victory tarnished by
compromise—but faintly across the fields,
through the open church door, the last verse of
the hymn came to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember when they used to have a harvest
supper in Thorpe’s big barn,” he said, turning
into the house. “Oh, well—in another
twenty years——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They used to drink too much at those harvest
suppers,” said the niece. “And you needn’t
talk—you’re a young man for your age, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did old Bateson sum up all the regret
and mystery of life, and thus did youth try to console
him for it—but those remarks pass in a
constant throb beneath our daily round; every
minute some one speaks so, and some one answers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then silence fell over the dim countryside, and
within the lighted church was a quiet murmur of
prayer and praise until the congregation rustled
up in their seats to bellow with a will, “Now
thank we all our God,” in the hymn before the
sermon. And the singing of that flooded the
fields with sound again until the last echo reached
the distant place where the Spirit of Ancient
Revelry slept the long years through behind some
bushes on a village green with scarcely ever a
waking hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this hymn awoke him, though it was badly
sung, and so very far away. For there lingered
in it something familiar that acted like a bugle-call—the
dear sound of people bellowing through
the night because the world was such a jolly place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was running in and out of the full pews, and
laughing over Mr. Thorpe’s shoulder, before the
first verse was finished—and both he and Mr.
Thorpe had a full-throated, jovial sense of finding
what they wanted in familiar company, which is
not surprising when you remember how often the
Spirit of Ancient Revelry had met Mr. Thorpe’s
ancestors in the big barn and other places. He
even stirred in the Werrits, who were so anxious
and progressive and modern, a sense of something
lost and found again, so that Mr. Will Werrit’s
nose and ears went crimson with his exertions,
and Mr. Tom Werrit felt a faint desire to wave
something during the last line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Banks of Millsby went up into the
pulpit and began to preach about another harvest
in that desolate and heart-breaking manner common
to harvest festival sermons, with reference
to those sheaves gathered in during the past year,
which caused the ladies of the congregation, already
a little emotional, to apply their handkerchiefs
and think what a beautiful preacher Mr.
Banks was, to be sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was a little windy sound through the
church as if an autumn storm were already brewing,
and every one thought “The summer’s over.”
But it was not the wind; it was the sigh with
which the Spirit of Ancient Revelry fled through
the open door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the service, Mr. and Miss Banks and
Mrs. Stamford and Mrs. Dixon with her daughter
Irene spoke together in the porch, and gave to the
occasion that air of Church and State greeting
each other which the elder people of Gaythorpe
still found fitting and pleasant, but the younger
ones went out wondering impatiently why others
should have motor-cars while they had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, good-bye; sorry you won’t stay supper,”
said Andy’s cheerful voice, and the Bankses
departed in their waiting cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No moon to-night—hope to see you on
Wednesday next!” shouted Mr. Banks back, already
on the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night! Good-night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lanes were full of that, and of cheerful
voices, for a little while, and then the stars looked
down on quiet hedgerows where the dew fell
silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Dixon and the girls had supper with Andy,
and when that lady said to Mrs. Jebb, “This is a
delightful spot, isn’t it, Mrs. Jebb?” she really
meant, “See what I have done for you.” And
when Mrs. Jebb answered, “Delightful, but dull,
of course,” she really meant. “I could get plenty
of other situations, but I am glad to oblige you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Phyllis, who looked flushed and excited
after the walk she had taken while they were all
at church, said it was time to go. And as her suggestions
were usually acted upon, they went; but
while Mrs. Dixon was speaking with Andy, the
two sisters had a few words together beneath the
snorting of the hired motor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you out walking all the time?” said
Irene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—why not?” said Phyllis shortly.
“There’s no harm in walking, is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends,” answered Irene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither put what they said into words, and yet
it <span class='it'>got</span> said—most clearly and definitely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that is where all books fail—they can
only convey the unimportant word and are
obliged to almost entirely leave out unspoken conversations—but
it is always the unspoken conversation
that matters.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Andy</span> leaned over the gate while the throb of the
motor grew fainter—ceased—and the dew fell
quietly upon the grassy edge of the lane. Already
lights shone from the upper windows of the village,
little stars of home twinkling out in brief,
pathetic bravery an answer to the eternal repose
of Charles’ Wain above the chimney stacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sense of home wrapped Andy close as he
stood there watching. During the last months
he had gained a new capacity for love—that
exquisite, human love of places which can never
be explained to those who do not know it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crunch! crunch!” sounded a faint footstep
on the distant gravel of the churchyard path—then
silence as the schoolmaster crossed the field—and
a smell of tobacco in the night air close at
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening. Very pleasant out,” said
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kirke stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something to have a harvest festival <span class='it'>about</span>
this year,” he said. “When you see the crops all
black in the fields——” he paused. “Fine congregation
to-night. And the way the hymns
went——” He paused and puffed again at his
pipe. “Mr. Thorpe tells me there was no less
than nineteen and tenpence in the collection
bags. Last year it was only eleven shillings
odd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men’s voices were softened and mellowed
by the night air—they felt friendly towards
one another. The schoolmaster refilled
his pipe as he too leaned against the gate, but in a
decorous attitude which expressed his sense of
being rather honoured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt thinks I must be frightfully lonely
here,” said Andy, unconsciously trying to bring
the talk round to the subject of which his mind
was full. “She thinks”—he laughed a little—“that
I ought to get a wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Willie Kirke settled his shoulders more
intimately against the gate—for that is a subject
in which bachelors of all ages feel an interest
at times—it is somehow pleasantly tickling to
think what the poor women have missed through
their abstinence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Kirke, striking a match that
flamed on his narrow face and bottle shoulders
as he lighted his pipe, “I don’t know if you lose
more’n you gain or gain more’n you lose by remaining
unmarried. There was only one girl I
ever——” Puff. Puff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did she——?” said Andy, through a
sympathetic pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, married a butcher! But I never asked
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should you——” Now was Andy’s chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should you think if a man were silly enough to
propose that he’d better do it by letter or in person?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed a little scornfully, and put it in a
detached manner—so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kirke kicked the gate thoughtfully with the
air of a man who meditates on a series of gallantries
so long that it takes some time to sort them
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far as my experience goes—mind you, I
don’t pose as one of your ladies’ men—but so
far as my experience goes, I should say, ‘Kiss
first and talk afterwards.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy moved a shade farther back into the
shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But supposing you <span class='it'>had</span> to write?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Kirke took his pipe from his mouth and
gazed before him into the soft dark. This was
what he liked. He had always been so clever and
ingenious that since that hour in his boyhood
when he had found he could mend the family
clock he had continued to feel himself in a position
to give a valuable opinion about everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had to write, I should make it short and
sweet. Very short and very sweet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But supposing a man had an awful lot to
say?” pursued Andy, trying still to sound detached
and careless, and throwing a horse chestnut
at a shrub to give the impression verisimilitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He could say it after they were married,”
replied Mr. Kirke with a chuckle. “Plenty of
time then, and to spare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She—she might not have him,” said poor
Andy, the inmost fear of his heart forcing its way
to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust her!” chuckled Mr. Kirke again. For
he held the profound conviction of most bachelors
over forty that no woman can resist a man if he
really does his best. “Well—good-night. I
must be getting home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy asked him to come in for a few
minutes, and they went together into the brightly-lighted
dining-room, where it did really seem incredible
that any one should have asked advice on
affairs of the heart from Mr. Kirke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy assumed a demeanour more nearly resembling
that of the senior curate than he had
shown for weeks, and he was very much the Vicar
of Gaythorpe as he rang the bell and ordered
light refreshments. But Mr. Kirke was impervious
to the change of atmosphere, and remarked
when Mrs. Jebb closed the door behind her—the
little maid was already in bed—“Been rather a
fascinating woman in her day, I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy started and his eyes began to twinkle, he
forgot to be imposing as he caught hold of an
idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very nice woman,” he said warmly. Then
he remembered that Mr. Kirke was his friend,
and felt bound to add, “She can’t cook—but
that’s——” He waved it off with the matchbox.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t look a cook,” said Mr. Kirke,
still in his character of the appraising dog. “But
fine eyes. Fine eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Jebb returned in the toilet which she
had worn at the harvest festival service, with
more odd bits of white lace and black ribbon floating
than seemed possible for one mortal costume
to contain, and she glanced at the schoolmaster as
she put down the tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid congregation, Mrs. Jebb,” said Mr.
Kirke, gallantly assisting with a corner of the
cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. Oh, excellent. And the decorations
so lovely,” said Mrs. Jebb, all aflutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she retired, and Mr. Kirke remarked—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite a lady. You can see <span class='it'>she</span> hasn’t been
bringing in trays all her life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy beamed at his guest, for he was at that
stage of sentiment when an ordinary man or
woman can no more help match-making than they
can help breathing—though men carefully hide
the craving. And after all, it is the most generous
part of love—that desire to pass on happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Jebb is so—so”—he sought for an
adjective which should truthfully recommend the
lady—“so chatty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Mr. Kirke, with the air of a connoiseur,
“I can understand that woman fascinating
a man who liked the airy-fairy type. It’s a
matter of taste. For my part I like an armful.
Always have. Always shall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Andy saw that his first attempt at match-making
had failed, and a few minutes later he
allowed his guest to depart without protest. Then
Mrs. Jebb went up to bed, after extinguishing the
lamps in the hall and dining-room according to
custom, and Andy sat down in his familiar seat
by the study table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He removed the sheet of blotting-paper which
covered his little heap of manuscript and shook
down the ink in his pen—after that he looked
across the garden, though all was black darkness
there and clouds had covered the stars; for it
had already become a habit for him to sit at that
table and look forth so. And Andy’s mother
would have yearned and wondered if he had
had one—to see the change in her boy. Boy
still, beneath it all, as the best men are until their
dying day—but putting on the mask of manhood.
For loneliness and responsibility form
such a forcing-house for qualities hitherto dormant
that developments take place which seem
almost incredible in the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lamplight caught Andy’s face, which no
stress could ever make anything but round and
jolly-looking. He would always have, even in
the deepest adversity, the appearance of a happy
person who has been wounded by some incomprehensible
mistake; but he looked now strong enough
to suffer without bitterness—and that is, after
all, the final test of strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he glanced out into the soft dark of the
garden with no one watching him to put his face
on guard, his eyes gradually grew luminous. It
was clear enough that he watched a dream. All
the hot vigour of a young man’s love flowed in a
molten tide into his imagination, where it blazed
up and made a crimson, leaping glorious flame that
enabled Andy to see quite clearly the City of Married
Love as it looks to the eyes of a pilgrim.
The high towers—the secret streets—the tender
mist that glorifies the Enchanted Muddle—he
seemed close to the gate as he sat there staring
at the dim form of the trees against a starless
sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the reading-lamp began to smell because
Mrs. Jebb had forgotten the oil that morning,
and of course Andy lost sight of his dream when
it became necessary to extinguish the lamp and
light a couple of candles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even that interruption did not cool the fire
within him; it only blew across the leaping flames
and caused the embers underneath to burn more
fierce and even—a still, red heart of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy shook out his pen again, and wrote on
a blank sheet—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he wrote it, he seemed to reach out towards
her with his very soul. He felt that she must
know, though she lay asleep with her cheek upon
the white pillow and her hair spread round her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep tenderness came over Andy as he pictured
her so—it seemed to flow through all
his being—how could he write a letter asking her
to marry him? A man must be a poet without
self-consciousness, a lover without fear, and a potential
husband without priggishness to do that
properly—and where do you find that man?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyway, not in poor Andy, who sat clutching
the mop of curls above his brow that had been
brilliantined so nice and flat for the harvest festival,
and who could get no further than—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know if you will be surprised to hear
that I love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He read it over. It sounded lame—awful!
He must think of something more suitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in about a week’s time the letter would
have to be sent. He had not liked to mention it
to Dick Stamford—a sort of fierce delicacy restrained
him—but of course Dick would be
obliged to say something when the end of his
period of probation arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now the end of the third week in September,
and October had been the time named;
but what part of October, Andy did not know.
In any case, it must be soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tore up the paper and started afresh—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Miss Elizabeth,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has long been my desire to tell you how
deeply——”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>No! He tore up that too, and flung it into the
waste-paper basket. Then he began to wonder
with a sort of smarting uneasiness what Dick
Stamford would put in his letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all very foolish, of course—the whole
plan from that beginning of it in the Stamfords’
billiard-room was ridiculous to the last degree—but
so, looked at in one way, are the chasings of
the first white butterflies above a violet bank, and
they are no less a part of springtime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy got up and walked about the room; then
he sat down again and began afresh, desperately—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Girl,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what to call you in a letter, because
you are everything to me, and I can’t tell
whether I am anything to you. But—”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>he paused, pen uplifted—that was surely a ring at
the doorbell. As he waited, for he had been too
much engrossed fully to take it in, another peal
echoed through the sleeping house and made the
matter certain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily flinging his papers into a drawer, he
went to the door, wondering, with a sudden anxious
tug at the heart as he ran along, who was ill
among the Gaythorpe folk, or what baby might
suddenly need christening? Brother Gulielmus
felt like that when men came with horn lanterns
to wake him at dead of night and pilot him to
some deathbed where the Devil wanted a lot of
fighting if the soul were to soar away from his
clutches. The little old house was gone, but it
stood on the same spot, and everything was shaping
Andy into the same sort of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clattered the chain down and flung open the
door. A dim figure stood in the shadow of the
porch without speaking. Andy peered forth, concerned
for one of his flock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there some one ill in the village?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy pushed back the door and came near to
the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—Stamford!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I was—er—passing. I thought I’d
drop in,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” said Andy briefly, leading the way
with a lighted candle in his hand. He expected
to hear his guest stumble, for it seemed improbable
that any one would call on a friend in the
country at one o’clock in the morning if he were
quite sober. But there was no sign of drink about
Dick as he stood near the mantelpiece, fidgeting
with the ornaments. He only looked very uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” said Andy, trying to treat it as an
ordinary call. “Been a lovely day, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stamford did not sit down, and his rather
heavy, florid face was deep crimson in the candlelight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to come,” he blurted out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. Used to late hours ever since you
left school. Sometimes feel you can’t go quietly
to bed. Here <span class='it'>I</span> am,” said Andy, carelessly indicating
the two candles and the writing-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stamford let a small china dog fall with a crash,
picked up the bits, apologised, and walked to the
bookshelf and back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here. I don’t know how to begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sit down to it, man,” said Andy, dragging
the big arm-chair forward. “Have a pipe?
Can’t offer you a cigar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stamford disregarded the invitation, and
backed up against the fireplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m engaged to Elizabeth Atterton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy’s glance flashed out, keen as a rapier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a joke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy tried to speak, but no words would come
from his dry throat. The room became misty
for a second, then it cleared, and Stamford was
saying, with no air of the triumphant lover—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dined with the Attertons, and after dinner
old Atterton told me I’d been a good boy, and I
might try my luck. And the old girl sent for me
to her room, where she was nursing that blessed
back of hers, and she cried, and said she hoped
Elizabeth would have me. So when they told me
to go down into the morning-room where Elizabeth
was—what could I do? After that—what
could I do? I couldn’t say I must wait until
I’d thought it over, when they’d been thinking it
over for a year. And I couldn’t say anything
about you—now, could I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose not,” he said with some difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m beastly sorry. I never felt in such a hole
in my life. I’d have given anything—<span class='it'>anything</span>,
to be out of it and safe at home. I never meant
to steal a march on you, Deane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that,” said Andy heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Stamford sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was in a d——d hole,” he repeated. “I
never meant to behave like a skunk. I was going
to suggest that we should both write to her on
the first of October, and let the devil take the
hindmost. You believe that, Deane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they both stared at the empty grate,
and at last Stamford got up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” he said, “if she’d wanted you she
wouldn’t have taken me, would she?” He paused,
and continued, arguing with himself as well as
Andy: “Those Atterton girls have had heaps of
chances. Neither of them would marry just for
the sake of getting married. If Elizabeth hadn’t
been willing, she would have said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Andy again. Then he pricked
his numbed senses into a little semblance of life.
“Oh yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t think I’m not appreciating the way in
which you stuck to your part of the bargain,” continued
Stamford, going uneasily towards the door.
“You behaved awfully well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then through the mist caused by pain in Andy’s
mind loomed the image of Lady Jones. What had
Lady Jones to do with it? Oh, he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was only by an—an accident, that I did
not break my promise and propose to her,” he
said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the words were out, he wondered
why he had said them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the two young men stood silent,
while a great thought, unspoken, almost uncomprehended,
vibrated between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never know——” was all Stamford
could find to say. Then he struggled and brought
forth a final word. “We all seem in the same
box, somehow, if you only knew. Well, good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they shook hands in the dark porch with
an extraordinary vista opening out before both
of them, blinding them for a moment to their own
misery and triumph. They saw—those two
ordinary young men on a doorstep—the road
on which all creation moves towards the light.
They knew that they were brothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stamford kicked the mat. He wanted to go,
and yet he could not get away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I may take it there’s no ill-feeling?”
he said mechanically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Andy, and after a pause he held
out his hand. “Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had had enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stamford escaped down the drive with a sense
of immense relief. It had been horribly unpleasant,
but it was over. Now for the next best
thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy, meantime, stood in the shadow of the
porch; he felt a queer reluctance to go back into
the study—the same meaningless dislike that a
child has for a place where it has been badly hurt,
instinctive, based on the shadowy, primitive beginnings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He closed the front door softly behind him,
and followed the path round the house towards
the church by force of habit. The night air blew
cool upon his hot forehead, and the queer thud of
his heart calmed down to its normal beat. But
as his physical sensations ceased to trouble him,
his realisation of what had happened grew clearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fought off the moment when he must not
only know, but realise, that Elizabeth could never
be his wife, but it came nearer, with the slow, inevitable
tread of such moments. He tried to pretend
that he was listening to the wind, then to the
clock striking two, then to a startled bird among
the bushes—the inevitable moment marched on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last it was upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But only the darkness, and the tomb of Brother
Gulielmus where he sat, knew how he got through
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About half-past three he went into the house,
and found all dark and silent, the candles guttered
out in their sockets. So he felt his way
upstairs and closed his door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he could not sleep, because he saw Stamford
every time he closed his eyes, and then Elizabeth
as she looked the first time he met her at
Mrs. Simpson’s sale; and all the time one sentence
of Stamford’s rang in his ears with hideous reiteration:
“After all—if she’d wanted you she
wouldn’t have taken me. After all....”
And so on, over and over again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The birds awoke to the tune of it—the little
maid creaked downstairs—Mrs. Jebb came more
lightly after—Sam tramped across the gravel beneath
the window—all to the same dull, aching
tune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Andy got up, bathed, shaved, and came
down to face a life without Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jebb, herself, brought in the bacon and
placed it on the table like a funeral meat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you have a boiled egg as well?” she
asked in a low tone, such as is used in suggesting
black gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you,” said Andy, opening the
paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or a poached one on toast?” she urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy glanced at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want nothing more, thank you,” he said,
curbing his impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Deane,” said Mrs. Jebb, “there’s news
in the village. I thought I would tell you myself.
Miss Elizabeth Atterton is engaged to Mr. Richard
Stamford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how did you hear that?” said Andy,
turning his paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Stamford’s groom told Sam Petch, and
he chanced to mention it at the back door,” said
Mrs. Jebb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“News soon flies round Gaythorpe,” said Andy.
“Will you tell Sam I shall want the pony-cart at
half-past nine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Mrs. Jebb had to go, but she ordered a
chicken for dinner, and apple-pudding, because
those were Andy’s favourite dishes, and she knew
that many a heart had been caught on the rebound.
Of what use were the novels she interminably
read, if not to teach her such things as
that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched the little maid peeling the apples
with a pensive eye, putting to herself the following
conundrum:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he send that letter I saw a copy of in the
waste-paper basket—or did he only <span class='it'>mean</span> to
propose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And her invariable comment on giving it up,
was: “Anyway, it’s all right now.” But even
to her own mind she did not use those words, because
those strange unspoken conversations can
also take place between a woman and herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the same she dined on a drumstick of
chicken and forced the little maid to do the same,
so that there would be more left for Andy, though
she knew he would never notice it if they finished
the fowl altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maid cocked her eye disdainfully at Mrs.
Jebb as they sat at meat, and said to herself:
“She needn’t bother to eat drumsticks—<span class='it'>she’ll</span>
never get him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which shows once more how unexpectedly
much, and how wonderfully little, everybody
knows about everybody else.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>If</span> Andy had been a woman, gall would have been
added to his sorrow by the sympathetic package
of sandwiches which Mrs. Jebb put into the pony-cart,
and by the carelessly careful remark which
Sam Petch made, glancing after the departing
flutter of her skirts, that women seemed to have
no sense, even the best of them, but that there
was one comfort, nobody need grieve over any
of them, because there were always as good fish
in the sea as ever came out of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, being a man, Andy did not notice
these indications of a knowledge that he had gone
fishing on the matrimonial shore to come back
with an empty basket. And he watched some apples
being placed in the cart for his friend the
Millsby joiner, whom he had once fought, without
any of the intense, nervous irritation which
must have followed a woman’s intuitive discovery
that she was being pitied and watched by those
about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The piebald pony went off, as gay as a little
pony can be who has a comfortable stable and
plenty to eat and very little to do; but deep within
his heart lurked the memory of past excitements,
and he was trotting decorously through Millsby,
every inch the parson’s pony, when he heard a
brass band playing the Ancient Order of Buffaloes
into their annual festivities, and he forgot everything
but that he was an artiste with a suppressed
talent for dancing on his hind legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the artistic temperament—even in
ponies—always brings inconveniences upon those
nearest the gifted one, it is not surprising that
Andy found himself in the road among a heap of
apples with a few ham-sandwiches across his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither was it surprising that Elizabeth should
be passing down the village street on her way from
a visit to Miss Banks, because she constantly went
there; but Andy, removing a ham-sandwich from
his eyes, and jumping up unhurt, did feel it to
be a particular irony of fate that she should be
passing at that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It really seemed as if fate, not content with
depriving him of her, was making faces at him
afterwards. But as the pony continued to execute
a <span class='it'>pas seul</span> to the wonder of all beholders and
the imminent detriment of the shafts, he was
obliged to run to the little animal’s head, and to
hold it until the band was safely housed in the
Public Hall opposite. By that time Elizabeth
had entered the grocer’s shop, where she remained
until the apples were restored to the cart,
and Andy departed, leaving only Mrs. Jebb’s
sandwiches on the road to show what had taken
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on his way, feeling peculiarly miserable.
Though he had dreaded the next meeting
with Elizabeth, he had vaguely pictured it as
something heroic—on his side, at any rate. Now
nothing was left but the intense and bitter realisation
that he was no more to her than any other
man who passed her on the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had wished, instinctively, to appear like
those renouncing heroes on the stage who always
wring the heart of the audience to soft music
when they are having the first interview with the
Beloved after she is Lost for Ever. And he had
appeared among a heap of apples with a disordered
ham-sandwich over his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But one advantage of it all was, nothing now
seemed to matter. When he came downstairs
that morning, he had dreaded keeping his appointment
with Mrs. Atterton about a church window
as a hurt man dreads the touch of a sore finger
on an open wound; now, he jogged up the long
drive feeling sure that nothing could happen at
Millsby Hall which would make the slightest difference
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Atterton?” he said at the door, with as
little anxiety as if he were asking for Mrs.
Thorpe. And he followed a servant into the big
morning-room all full of light and people and
flowers and sunshine—a sort of temple to the
jolly spirit of the Atterton family—with no more
sense that he was standing on holy ground than
as if he had found Mr. Thorpe smoking a pipe in
his leather-covered arm-chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please don’t send my pony round to the
stables—I must only stay a few minutes—I am
on my way to Marshaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Often on your way to Marshaven,” chuckled
the irrepressible Bill. “But your cousins aren’t
the ordinary sort, more kin than kind. These are
more kind than kin, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are the daughters of the first husband
of my aunt by marriage,” said the Vicar of Gaythorpe,
who was in no mood for jesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he and Bill had been such good friends that
the young gentleman failed to realise this; and,
taking Andy’s dignified reply for a joke, he
laughed uproariously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha-ha! ‘If Peter’s mother married’——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush,” interrupted Mrs. Atterton, but smiling
too, “it’s a lucky thing you go back to Cambridge
to-morrow. You need toning down a little.
Now, Mr. Deane, as we have not much time,
perhaps we ought to begin about the window at
once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy rose, supposing she would lead him to a
more retired room, but that was not the Attertons’
way; so she only beckoned him into a corner,
while Bill continued to laugh and talk with Norah
by the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Atterton looked in to say he was just
off to a meeting of county justices, and when Mrs.
Atterton indicated the subject of her discussion
with Andy, he said in a rather less breezy tone,
“Ah yes. The window, of course. It must be
attended to at once. My poor aunt wanted one
with birds in, if possible, Mr. Deane. She owned
William, you know. Left instructions in her will
about the window. I suppose——” he paused,
eyed Andy dubiously—“I can’t recall to mind
any Biblical parrot—but if there were——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Andy was as miserable as a man well
could be, but he was also one of those whom the
deepest sorrow cannot blind to the blessed funniness
that is always shining out, like stars in a dark
sky, to help travellers for whom life’s road would
otherwise become impassable; and when he saw
Mr. Atterton’s face—reverent yet annoyed—while
that gentleman searched mentally the pages
of Holy Writ with an inward, “Deuce take it!
why <span class='it'>isn’t</span> there a parrot?” he could no more help
smiling inwardly than he could help breathing.
However, he replied, with a gravity befitting the
subject—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are other birds—something can easily
be arranged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right. That’s all right,” said Mr.
Atterton. “Of course, it’s of no real importance,
but when you know what people would have
liked and they’re not there to speak for themselves,
you know——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left it at that and went off with a brisk
farewell, to encounter Elizabeth in the doorway,
who half turned to go when she saw Andy, but
came on after all and shook hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I offer you my heartiest congratulations—Mrs.
Atterton has been telling me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, the impossible had happened, and the
world went on just the same; so one sort of youth
was past for Andy, by the time Mrs. Atterton
added—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We <span class='it'>are</span> so delighted, Mr. Deane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she did not look at him as she said it, because
of what Norah had once told her, and because
the poor boy might have had a passing fancy
for Elizabeth. So many young men had suffered
in that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be glad to have your daughter
near,” replied Andy, with so much calmness that
Mrs. Atterton felt greatly relieved. It would be
highly unpleasant if there <span class='it'>were</span> anything—with
Elizabeth at the Manor and Mr. Deane at the
Vicarage—so inconvenient at Mothers’ Meetings
and Christmases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at her girl with tears of joy in her
eyes because they were not to be parted farther
than the next parish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Elizabeth looked back at her mother, the
colour started under her eyes and slowly crept
under her whole face. It was like watching a
rose open softly; and her tremulous mouth that
she pursed up to keep firm, was like the heart of
a rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy put out his hand hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll be off now, Mrs. Atterton. You
shall have the sketches and estimates as soon—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, wait a moment,” interrupted Mrs.
Atterton. “Oh, here <span class='it'>is</span> Edwards with the tray.
You must have a sandwich before you start on
your drive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy did not want a sandwich, of course, but
it was impossible to refuse being fed by Mrs. Atterton
without being boorish, because she made it
so the outward and visible sign of that atmosphere
which pervaded the Atterton household. So he
ate a combination of bread and meat which ought
to have been very good, but which tasted like
chaff to him at that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others came round and took a cup of tea
or a glass of milk and sweet cakes or sandwiches,
with no appearance of wanting them particularly,
but rather as a further expression of the family
sentiment: “If there <span class='it'>is</span> anything pleasant going
let’s be in it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth’s cake, in fact, crumbled in her saucer,
while she drank the tea thirstily enough; and
Bill remarked with a chuckle—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say—no breakfast—and now leaving her
cake! Our Elizabeth ‘wants to willow,’ now
she’s an engaged young woman, but banting won’t
do it.” He clapped his sister on the back:
“You’re not made that way, my girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Attertons all laughed—not because there
was anything to laugh at—but because the schoolmaster’s
saying had passed into one of those family
jokes which are so dear and silly. For this
is age—when there is no one left who knows the
family jokes—when there is nobody in all the
world to whom an idiotic remark means youth and
hope and the golden days gone by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well,” said Norah, coming to the rescue
with the freemasonry that exists between sisters,
“one lamp-post is enough in any family, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood near the window, erect, smiling, alert,
so exceedingly able to take care of herself and
other people too, if necessary. And she continued,
after looking out at some one passing, “I
forgot—we’re going to have another in the family
soon—here she is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later Mrs. Stamford was ushered in,
or rather she did not wait for that, but hurried
on ahead of the panting Edwards and across the
expanse of carpet that separated her from Mrs.
Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear—I’m so glad—I’m so glad——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was significant that her unusual outburst of
emotion did not culminate, as would have been
natural, upon Elizabeth’s shoulder, but upon that
of the girl’s mother. For once the ideas and traditions
of a lifetime were in abeyance, and she
came straight, swept along by an overwhelming
tide of relief and thankfulness, to the one person
in the world who would understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve walked all the way?” said Mrs. Atterton,
patting the hard, slim hand of her visitor.
“How sweet of you to come like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stamford half turned to Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so delighted, Elizabeth, my dear, I can
never say how delighted——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she somehow became aware of the other
people in the room, and sat up straight, remarking
hastily, “Cold coming on. Been taking quinine.
Always makes me so excitable. Only thing that
does. I could drink a hogshead of port—but
quinine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect the capacity for unlimited port is
hereditary. Weren’t <span class='it'>all</span> our ancestors, three-bottle
men?” said Norah, composedly, tiding over
the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The doctors all say my back is owing to that—gouty
tendencies, you know,” assisted Mrs.
Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And everybody felt immensely relieved to get
down to Mrs. Atterton’s back from the emotional
heights where they had stood during the past
three minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it had been evident, even to young Bill,
that Mrs. Stamford was saying a Magnificat as
plainly as ever a Hebrew woman did in the days
of old. And no mother ever rejoiced in the birth
of a new life with a greater ecstasy of joy and
thankfulness, than did Mrs. Stamford, in this beginning
of a new life for her son. It seemed,
after all the hidden suspense and agony of mind,
as if he had been born again to her. She was so
certain he would settle down to be all she had
hoped and dreamed, when he was once married
to Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mrs. Atterton had never known any harm
of Dick save that he was, at one time, like other
young fellows, a little wild. So his exemplary
behaviour of late had quite disarmed both her
and Mr. Atterton, and they were inclined to admire
the honourable way in which he had kept
the spirit as well as the letter of the arrangement
come to a year ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Norah was glad for her sister to be mistress
of such a fine historical place as Gaythorpe
Manor, and greatly relieved that there was now
no danger of her becoming the wife of a country
parson; while Bill was pleased to think ‘good old
Elizabeth’ would remain, as it were, a part of
home, with excellent shooting to offer in addition
to her present virtues, and a five-pound note ever
at the service of a brother who always seemed to
run short of money at critical moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So everybody was pleased, and there was so
much unspoken congratulation in the atmosphere
that poor Andy felt rather choked with it by the
time he got away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before he was really out of the house he
encountered Dick Stamford, who had motored
round by Bardswell, and who bore in his hands
a bunch of flowers and an immense box of chocolates
tied with pink ribbons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young men passed with a nod and a
muttered “Good morning,” but Stamford stopped
a second later, turned back, and said with some
effort, “Jolly morning. Cold, though. Frost in
the air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Beautiful flowers you’ve got,” said
Andy, equally uncomfortable, and speaking at
random. “Chocolates, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know what girls like,” said Stamford
with an uneasy laugh. “Something pretty to
look at and something good to eat. All alike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy did not pause to discuss this view of
the feminine nature, and they parted with another
constrained nod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, on the way to Marshaven, Andy
began to wonder if he could stay on at Gaythorpe
when Elizabeth came to the Manor, and Mr. and
Mrs. Stamford had retired to the Dower Lodge,
as they intended to do upon their son’s marriage.
He began to think he could not endure it. Then
he turned a corner and felt on his face the cold,
salt air that blows across the flat country near
Marshaven, and all the sane manliness in him was
stirred into activity again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Give up his work because the girl he wanted
was going to marry some one else and live next
door!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ya-a-a-h! howled the winds in contemptuous
protest, across autumn fields where men, all bent
with age and toil, were following the plough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy whipped up Tommy and sat very straight
in the little cart as the wheels twinkled, merry
green and red, through the streets of Marshaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Dixon with her daughters, the Webster
girls, was living in a large bow-windowed house
facing the sea, and from her post in an arm-chair
on the sunny side of the window she waved to
Andy as he went in. He felt how elegant and
fashionable she was, when she rose in her tight
bodice with her tight curls in perfect order and a
bluish bloom upon her nose—just as he had always
felt when he came home from school or college
and she received him kindly. For women
gain the same hold on men by being always in full
regimentals as soldiers do upon savages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Andy,”—she had always been kind,
but now she was doubly kind—“how pleased I
am to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I must run over to say good-bye, as
you were off to-morrow,” said Andy, shaking
hands with the girls, who seemed, in this strong
morning light off the sea, more especially endowed
with eyes and hair and neck than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not going until the end of the month,
now. We’ve changed our minds,” said Phyllis.
And she closed her lips in a way which intimated
that she was in the habit of making up the family
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such nice people about, and so kind,” said
Irene. “Ridiculous idea that we had before
about county society being sidey. Of course they
<span class='it'>can</span> be—you can see that—even your Elizabeth
has it in her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy took a breath like a man going for a big
ditch; then he said with a laugh—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you heard? She is Mr. Stamford’s
Elizabeth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There—it could not have been done in a worse
or more tasteless way, he knew, but it was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” cried Mrs. Dixon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Stamford engaged—you can’t mean it!”
said Irene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Phyllis. Nothing else. But she
wore Eastern beads that morning, with a flimsy
blouse, and her expression now matched her toilet—she
looked somehow like a chorus girl who had
strayed accidentally into melodrama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a good deal more conversation on the
subject, during which Andy really felt as if he were
walking with bare feet on red-hot cinders, he rose
to depart, in spite of an urgent invitation to remain
for luncheon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you <span class='it'>must</span> have a sandwich,” urged Mrs.
Dixon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He replied most truly that he would rather not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if you won’t stay to lunch we shall <span class='it'>insist</span>,”
said Irene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should really consider it quite unkind,”
said Mrs. Dixon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he was obliged to masticate another sandwich,
and that seemed to add the last touch to his
desolation. For though it is a dignified and even
heroic thing to be dogged through misfortune by
dragons, there is only plain annoyance in being
dogged by ham-sandwiches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the climax was reached when Andy, long
after luncheon time, arrived home and awaited
tea in his study, where the maid appeared bearing
the tray, while Mrs. Jebb fluttered after with a
plate in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought,” said she, signing to her underling
to depart, “that you would be glad of a few
sandwiches after your drive. We had nothing but
ham in the——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped short with her mouth open, for Andy
had seized the plate from her and flung the sandwiches
upon the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bread and butter,” he said thickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was atrocious. It was everything that can
possibly be said against such an action. But it
did Andy good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only drawback was that he had to spend
quite an hour, later in the evening, in talking to
Mrs. Jebb about Mr. Jebb and the glories of the
past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they parted, Mrs. Jebb, having forgiven
him, eye-cornered him from the doorway and
said, very softly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand. I know what”—she made a
pause—“what <span class='it'>tooth</span>-ache is, myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt sure he would also understand that by
“tooth” she meant “heart.” Only a woman can
put these things delicately enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy stared after her in heavy amazement
as the door closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toothache!” he thought to himself. “Surely
I haven’t been telling her I had toothache, have
I? Oh, well, it doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few minutes he sat staring into the fire,
then he got up and went to his desk, and his work
gained strength, no doubt, as work always does,
from love and sorrow decently borne.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Real</span> jollity is as antiseptic as sunshine, and when
Andy sat in a leather chair opposite Mr. Thorpe,
with Mrs. Thorpe presiding over an immense
batch of the first mince-pies which had been
brought out for his refreshment, he unconsciously
felt the bitterness of his grief being sweetened and
purified. It had been a lonely and disappointing
time lately, and he had watched the autumn leaves
hanging thick on the trees ready to fall at the
first gale, with a leaden dulness of heart that was
sapping his vitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he trudged back and forth to the little
church past the resting-place of Brother Gulielmus
he thought often that so he would lie, his little
day’s work done, and he had an intense consciousness
of the futility of life, though he worked hard
and tried to fight against it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-night, he had come down to the Thorpes’,
because Mrs. Thorpe asked him, with a heavy
sense of all places being alike; and now, though
they had discussed nothing but the crops and the
weather, his bitterness was already changing into
that good grief which never yet harmed a man,
in a wholesome atmosphere of mince-pies and
blazing autumn logs—or rather, in the atmosphere
of sane and strong acceptance of life as it
is which emanated from the Thorpes present, and
the generations of Thorpes who had gone before.
They—those older Thorpes—and the Will Ford
who was afterwards Gulielmus had doubtless sat
through long evenings after harvest-time in exactly
the same atmosphere as surrounded Andy
at present—and a sturdy sense of a man’s right
to work and gain strength by working—and of a
man’s right to suffer and grow fine by suffering—took
hold of Andy’s soul to the exclusion of that
weak dream of universal ease which had been,
unconsciously, the outcome of a modern education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For when Mrs. Thorpe said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have another mince-pie—<span class='it'>do</span>,” she really
voiced, quite without it, the brave and kind
thoughts of those who had been strong enough to
take life gladly, and urged Andy to follow their
example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Mr. Thorpe said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall pull our damsons to-morrow. We
waited until they’d had a touch of frost on them
to take the tartness off. Have you pulled yours
yet?” he really spoke of all those things, deep
hidden, which make a man ready to do his day’s
work here and trust in God for the reward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as they sat round the fire, their tongues
speaking of the unchanging springtime and harvest,
and their souls of the unchanging day’s work
and faith in the end, they belonged—those three—to
no time or place. They were so absolutely
unconsciously above and beyond all that, and any
man who has ever thought from the far misty
dawn of history until now, might have slipped into
the fourth empty chair, and talked with them and
understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Mrs. Thorpe began to speak of Elizabeth’s
wedding, and wondered what the bridesmaids
would wear, and brought out a silver cream-jug
which she and Mr. Thorpe were presenting
to the young couple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear the Squire is going to the Little
House,” said Mr. Thorpe, for so the Dower
Lodge was called in the village. “But he fails a
bit, week by week, though he isn’t an old man.
He’ll be glad to see his son settled in and managing
everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why they are hurrying the marriage
on so. Only five days from now,” added Mrs.
Thorpe. “I have heard people say, ‘Short
a-doing—long a-rueing!’ but it can’t be so in
this case, I think. They do seem to have everything
the heart can want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice-looking girl,” said Mr. Thorpe, taking
the masculine view. “Very.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Stamfords have gold plate, if they like
to use it, and no young man ever made a worse
husband for having sown his wild oats first,” said
Mrs. Thorpe, following with the feminine outlook.
“Shall you assist at the ceremony, Mr.
Deane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Andy. Then he added more
quietly, “I don’t expect to. They will have
Mr. Banks, of course, and probably other old
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyway, it’s poor fun marrying a pretty
girl to somebody else,” concluded Mr. Thorpe,
knocking out his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after that Andy went home, and he was
met in the hall by Mrs. Jebb, who informed him
that Mrs. Simpson—with whom she was now on
terms of armed neutrality—had been to ask him
about fetching her sideboard home. It appeared
that an empty removal van would be passing her
house early the following morning, and the men
had promised to bring the sideboard from the
Vicarage, if agreeable to Mr. Deane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy glanced at his watch and saw it was already
past eleven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go round myself and tell her that it is
all right,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a shame for you to turn out again after
your hard day,” said Mrs. Jebb sentimentally.
“Mrs. Simpson has made more trouble about that
hideous sideboard——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Andy was already half-way down the steps,
so Mrs. Jebb resumed her candle and went up to
bed, leaning awhile from her casement to watch
the Hunter’s moon shining splendid over the
massed tree-tops, and to dream vaguely of pale-grey
satin and orange blossoms. Then she drew
down her blind and perused a novel called <span class='it'>An
Autumn Rose</span>, which had a heroine whose virgin
heart had remained untouched until she was well
over forty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy ran along with his hands in his pockets,
for the night was sharp with a touch of frost,
and as he turned out of his own gate he paused
for a moment to glance, like Mrs. Jebb, at the extraordinary
brilliance of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little village lay asleep; all the windows
with drawn blinds on one side of the houses were
glittering and shining in the moonlight like golden
windows in some enchanted dream. The sky
stretched above them, calm and wide and clear,
with little waves of gold around the moon. There
was scarcely a breath of wind stirring, and Andy
stood in the shadow of the tree, quite still, so that
he gave no sign of life to the white empty road.
Any one passing would have fancied himself quite
alone. Any one coming across the field-path from
Gaythorpe Manor and standing on the step of the
fence might have looked over the still landscape
and fancied himself the only waking soul in all
that quiet world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth, standing on that step of the fence
and looking at the windows of Andy’s house,
which were pale golden in the moonshine, evidently
thought she was quite alone; and her face
appeared stronger and more reposeful than any
one who had seen her laughing in the daytime
would have thought possible. The clear, bright
light seemed to have drawn away the girlish softness
of her features, and her tender colouring, and
to have left her as she would be if the joys and
passions of life had all gone from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she stood there, quite still, in the full moonlight,
with a white cloak round her and a white
scarf over her head, against the luminous darkness
of the sky, she was more like some noble
abbess come to life again than a young lady who
intended to be married in five days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was no chance resemblance, but a
strange, momentary impression of a mental state
upon the outward appearance—for Elizabeth
would have become an abbess if, with her position
and her character and her large private
means, she had lived a few centuries earlier. She
did so fundamentally belong to that type of
woman who says to herself, “If I can’t be happy,
I will be good,” which is quite illogical, of course,
because that type of woman is always good to start
with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as she paused, motionless, with her hand
at her breast holding the close-drawn scarf, it was
clear that the mahogany sideboard, in the guise
of a harbinger of fate, had been at it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy ran forward out of the shadow and said
breathlessly, in a voice which he scarcely knew
to be his own—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were looking at my windows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth gave a great start, and her face was
very white in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, half whispering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you come for?” said Andy, pressing
nearer to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood under a sycamore tree in the lane,
but they could not see each other because a cloud
sailed across the moon: it was very dark and
still. Then the cloud passed—a little wind stirred—and
immediately a thousand dusky stars of
shadow quivered on the white radiance of the
moonlit road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you come?” repeated Andy a second
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was enough light now for them to see
into each other’s eyes, and what they saw there
changed, for a moment, that white road with the
stars of shadow quivering on it, to the floor of
heaven. They forgot, for that one moment, that
there was anything in earth or heaven but the
love they saw in each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you come, dear?” whispered Andy
with his arms about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To see your home. To say good-bye,” said
Elizabeth. “Oh, Andy, I thought you didn’t
care for me. I thought you had changed your
mind at the last minute. Why did you keep
away until it was too late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promised Stamford,” said Andy. “We
both wanted you, and he had to wait until his year
was out. I tried to play fair. I didn’t want to
make him lose heart when he had done his best
to keep straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How good of you. Dear Andy, how good
of you,” said Elizabeth, smoothing the shoulder,
of his rough coat with that comforting touch
which women keep for their lovers and their
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; it was not good,” said poor Andy, choking
a little, “because I never expected to lose you.
I thought you loved me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Elizabeth threw her arms round his neck
and sobbed out—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do love you. Oh, I do love you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they stood, clasped together, until Andy
loosed his arms from about her for a moment;
but he took her into them again with a low cry
that came from the very depths of his being—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t let you go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, in a little while, it became clear to these
two foolish—or wise—young people that they
must let each other go. Perhaps it was because
they stood on the floor of heaven and so saw
things beyond the stars, that even their own
earthly happiness began to look a small thing beside
the destruction of Dick Stamford’s soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I to do?” said Elizabeth. “Poor
Mrs. Stamford——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke off, and the memory of that Magnificat
in the Attertons’ morning-room swept with
desolating conviction across their hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you accept Stamford when you loved
me?” said Andy. “Even if you supposed I
didn’t care, you need not have done that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought,” said Elizabeth—and here it all
came out—“I thought if I could not be happy
myself I could make a great many other people
happy. I could do some good with my life. I
should never have taken Dick Stamford if I
had not felt I could do some good with my life
in that way. And I knew I could never be happy
without you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, it was all foolishness, of course; but
shadowy generations of good women stood behind
Elizabeth as she said that, and the ladder of useless
self-sacrifice on which they stood reached very
high up: even as far, perhaps, as the dreams of
those who know that their first duty is to themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyway, there was something rather wonderful
about the look of Andy and Elizabeth when they
came forth from the shadow of the tree and
walked together across the field. Their young
faces were a little stern, and the radiance about
them seemed in some strange way to be more a
white fire of the spirit triumphing over the flesh
than any ordinary moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked quietly, and scarcely spoke, but
the things which usually seem unreal were near
realities, and those things which usually seem real
did not matter. Even though they saw the City
of Wedded Love, the Enchanted Muddle, in ruins
before them, a light streamed from somewhere
farther on that made the ruins glorious—a huge
altar to the God of Love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last they came suddenly, from behind a
clump of trees, upon the garden of Gaythorpe
Manor. And things began to be real—or unreal—again,
according as you may take it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you get away?” said Andy in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went to my room with a headache, but when
I looked out and saw the moonlight I thought a
turn alone would do me good. They’d given me
the great guest-chamber where Anne Boleyn once
slept; and it has little stone steps leading from a
terrace into the garden. So it was easy enough.”
Her lip quivered. “I don’t know how women
would get on without headaches, Andy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy smiled tenderly, for all his unhappiness,
at the queer mixture which is a woman: and when
a man has learned to do that, he understands a
great deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little girl,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that somehow touched a chord of human
and dear things that nearly broke their hearts,
and without knowing how, they found themselves
clinging together, their faces wet with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” said Andy, trying to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” said Elizabeth, clinging to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it was Elizabeth who tried to go, and
Andy who held her fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came so, nearer and nearer to the little
stone staircase, and when Elizabeth put her foot
on the first step, Andy felt as if his life were going
from him. Silently she went and silently he
watched her go, with beads of sweat standing on
his forehead that the night wind changed to drops
of ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the top she turned and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to answer, but no sound would come
from his dry throat—then the door closed, and he
went back across the moonlit field.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was the day before Elizabeth’s wedding. For
three days a gale of wind had been tearing across
the country, shrieking through empty houses, rattling
loose doors, beating with blasts of sharp
raindrops like stones upon unprotected windows—seeming,
in a way, to rejoice in its fierce work of
changing the enchanted lane past Andy’s house,
which had been thick with autumn foliage only
three days ago, into something equally beautiful
but quite different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For now it was all over, and the little world
rested, tired and lovely, after all the buffeting;
there was an exquisite delicacy in the cool sunshine
on the fallen leaves, and in the tracery of fine
branches on a pale-blue sky, which Andy could
not help noticing though Elizabeth was going to
be married to-morrow. And it comforted him a
little, even in that great sorrow, because there is
no grief in life to which such dear sights will not
bring a little comfort, when once you learn to
really love them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy had been working hard in the wrecked
garden for an hour before breakfast, and as he
turned to go in he saw the two Simpson children,
Sally leading, Jimmy dragging reluctantly, come
round the turn towards his gate. So he invited
them to walk in and partake of oranges while he
ate his bacon; and after awhile, having disposed
of her orange, Sally came across to his side with
her anxious look on her small face, and said hesitatingly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Deane, I came for something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Go ahead,” said Andy, drinking
his tea thirstily and looking as if he had not slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something partickler,” said Sally. She
seemed to find expression a difficulty, but at last
continued: “Mother says you earn your living
by making people be good. I asked her what
you did for a living, and she told me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stared at his small visitor, then glanced
out of the window towards the place, beyond the
churchyard hedge, where Brother Gulielmus slept
in faith: then he sighed and returned to Sally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I try,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then,” said Sally, dragging Jimmy forward
suddenly from his orange, “I want you to
begin on him. He’s been <span class='it'>so</span> bad the last three
days. He doesn’t <span class='it'>mean</span> to be, and I didn’t much
mind him breaking my dolly, but now he’s pulled
the blue china teapot off the table in the best
room and smashed that, and we daren’t tell
mammy, so we came out. I was minding him,”
wept Sally, descending to tears at last, “but how
<span class='it'>can</span> you mind anybody that won’t be minded?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy turned very red and eyed his sister’s
tears askance, but he planted his legs wide apart
and said sturdily—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to be bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t love Sally, then?” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy glared at him for a moment, then flew,
all arms and legs, across the room and began to
pommel such portions of his Vicar’s person as he
could reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>do</span> love Sally. I <span class='it'>do</span> love Sally. Naughty
Parson Andy!” he bellowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jimmy,” cried Sally, shocked out of her
tears, and clasping her little thin hands distractedly.
“You mustn’t call him that. Mammy
said he would never let us come here any more if
we did—never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That did reach Jimmy’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more chocs. No more noranges!” he
wept. “I will be a good boy, I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t help being a bad boy,” wept Sally
in concert. “But I brought him for you to make
him <span class='it'>want</span> to be good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like you to call me Parson Andy,” said that
gentleman, pulling up a weeping parishioner upon
each knee, and proceeding to administer choice
bits of bread and butter laden with marmalade to
each in turn, with the tale of “The White Cat”
as a mental restorative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was upon this group that Mrs. Stamford was
ushered in by the excited little maid-servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to interrupt you at breakfast, but——”
began Mrs. Stamford. Then she broke off.
“What’s this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lady and gentleman who called to consult
me in a spiritual difficulty,” said Andy, rising.
“I’ll see them to the door and then I am at your
service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stamford sat down, her old tweed skirt
very wet about the hem with crossing the grass
field, and her weather-beaten hat well over her
eyes, but her appearance indefinably more emotional
than usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come,” she said without further circumlocution,
“to tell you we shall be obliged to have
the wedding at Gaythorpe Church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What wedding?” said Andy, though he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dick’s, of course,” said Mrs. Stamford, and
she might just as well have said, “What a fool
you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Andy, and he had a difficulty
even in saying that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because Millsby Church has been so injured
by the gale that it cannot possibly be put right in
time. Part of the steeple blown down. Roof
broken in. I always told Mr. Banks that it would
happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Andy, after a pause which
he knew to be growing long and yet was almost
powerless to end, “I shall be glad to help you
in any way I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if you’ll come with me—I have Sims the
head gardener waiting outside—we will go to the
church at once and see about the decorations. I
have arranged with Mrs. Atterton that we will
help with them, as we are so near, though their
gardener will decorate the chancel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy took the keys from their familiar place on
the nail in the hall, and as he went up the path
past Brother Gulielmus, he had, for a strange second,
a feeling as if some voice outside had said,
“Be a man. Keep a brave heart, my brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course it could only be the association of
ideas grown vivid through emotion, but it made
Andy square his shoulders and give his best attention
to the necessary arrangements for the ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really,” said Mrs. Stamford, when they had
finished, “your advice has been quite invaluable.
Poor Mr. Banks——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has not been curate in a fashionable London
parish,” said Andy grimly. “We’re used to
arranging theatrical performances there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was the only sign he gave of the
bitterness which underlay his ready interest in the
decorations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stamford glanced at her watch and caught
up her gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No idea it was so late,” she said. “Dick
is coming by the eleven train. We expected him
yesterday, but he was delayed—diamonds not finished
re-setting, and he wanted to bring them with
him. I do hope he won’t miss the train; it starts
so early from London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’ll turn up all right,” said Andy calmly—while
all his being cried out, “Miss his train—when
he is going to marry Elizabeth to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were almost at the church door now, and
Mrs. Stamford turned to give a last injunction
about the music, when a queer, hoarse voice which
neither of them recognised struck upon their ears,
and they turned sharply round to see Mr. Stamford
standing in the porch on the arm of his
man-servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen,” he said, and then he sank upon the
stone seat of the porch, motioning the man to go
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down beside him, schooling herself to
quietness, but white to the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, James. What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened his hand and held out to her a
crumpled sheet of paper which lay upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our son,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stamford took the telegram, and what
she saw, though it was bad enough, was so much
less terrible than she had feared that she broke
out into a passion of weeping that could not be
stayed, and she cried through it all—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s alive! He’s alive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So long as he lived, whatever he did, there
would always be something left in the world for
his mother, and she gave the telegram to Andy
with a brief “This concerns you, too,” which was
bitter enough but not hopeless.</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry to cause trouble. Cannot hope to make
you understand. Married to Phyllis Webster by
registrar this morning. Will Mother tell Elizabeth
at once.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in a burst of feeling at the end—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“Awfully happy but for complications, hope
you and Mother will forgive.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Complications,” said Andy stupidly, while the
pews raced swiftly round him and seemed to settle,
queerly enough, with a thump inside his head,
into their accustomed places. “Of course—complications.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the use of standing and muttering
that?” demanded Mrs. Stamford, wiping her
eyes. “It’s all terrible—terrible—but we must
make the best of it. She is your connection, and
respectable, though she has such eyes and stockings,
and it might very well have been the back
row of the ballet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is only in such moments as these that the
raw truth comes out, and it is infectious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is good enough for your son, and she will
see that he behaves himself—I know that,” Andy
retorted. “She has a will of iron under a fluffy
exterior, and that’s exactly the sort to manage
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Stamford said agitatedly—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must go to Elizabeth. Poor girl! Poor
girl! To think that my son——” he broke off,
grey about the mouth, and leaned back against
the stone wall of the porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stamford pulled her weather-beaten hat
farther over her forehead, and started, without
another word, down the path; but before she was
out of hearing her husband called hoarsely,
“Ellen! Ellen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran back and bent over him as he leaned
back, spent, against the stone, and in his bodily
weakness and bitter disappointment he whispered
to her, “Ellen—I can’t be left—you can’t leave
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw that it would be quite unsafe either to
agitate him still further or to make him move
from that seat, and yet—what was she to do?
That poor girl—those poor Attertons—they must
be told at once—every moment was of value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Stamford himself, with closed eyes and
fluttering breath, solved the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let Deane go,” he said feebly. “The parson—it’s
the best thing. He can ask to see Atterton
and explain—I’m ill—take the telegram.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——” began Mrs. Stamford, when she
saw that her husband could bear no more, and she
silently held out the telegram to Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must. It’s your duty,” interrupted Mrs.
Stamford in an urgent whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy drew a long breath. How could he go
on such an errand—he who was in such a turmoil
of love and hope and amazement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you,” he said desperately, “I wanted to
marry her myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does that matter? Go!” said Mrs.
Stamford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he glanced once more at the spent man upon
the stone seat of the porch and went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he saw nothing about him, but soon
the shock of unexpected joy, which stuns for a
while like unexpected sorrow, gave place to realisation.
Then every dewdrop, on every little blade
of grass he passed, seemed like a joybell ringing;
and the fine branches of the leafless trees wrote
love letters upon the tender sky, and a huntsman’s
horn far off was like love’s herald, ushering in the
bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he stood at the Attertons’ door asking
if Mr. Atterton were at home, things became
more ordinary; and when the man replied that his
master had gone to Bardswell, but the mistress
was at home, Andy replied in a state of embarrassed
discomfiture that he wished to see Mrs.
Atterton alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment or two the man returned and
ushered Andy into the morning-room where Elizabeth
and her mother sat together. After one
glance at his face, Elizabeth’s own grew very pale,
and she stood with her hands crushed together,
not offering to greet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I might have a moment with you alone,
Mrs. Atterton?” said Andy, very grave and
nervous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My husband!” exclaimed Mrs. Atterton.
“Oh—that young horse—I have begged him
not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no. It’s not Mr. Atterton—nothing to
do with him,” interrupted Andy hastily. “Nobody
is hurt. I have only come with a message
from Mr. Stamford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why did you frighten me like that?”
demanded Mrs. Atterton, not unnaturally.
“Knowing as you do that my back will not stand
shocks of any kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Andy’s sense of doing it as badly as such
a thing could be done, was intensified by this to a
pitch where he found the greatest difficulty in continuing;
and Elizabeth’s wide eyes, dark with startled
emotion, never left his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was to ask to see you alone, Mrs. Atterton,”
he said, lamely enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Elizabeth, speaking for the first
time. “I must hear what there is to tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy just glanced her way and turned again to
her mother—he dared not trust himself to look at
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Atterton,” he said, “I have been sent
by Mr. Stamford, who is so upset that Mrs. Stamford
cannot leave him, to tell you that—that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was of no use—the words refused to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” breathed Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For goodness sake get on,” cried Mrs. Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stamford was married to Phyllis Webster at
a registrar’s in London this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Andy stood, straight and white, in the middle of
the hearthrug; Elizabeth buried her face in her
hands with her elbows on the table, very still;
Mrs. Atterton sobbed out, “My poor girl! My
poor little girl!” and ran to throw her arms round
her daughter. But Andy was there first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You care?” he said breathlessly. “You’re
sorry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the whole world seemed to wait upon her
answer as she lifted her face from her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so happy—I feel as if I should die,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they forgot Mrs. Atterton and everything
else but themselves in the lovely view that opened
out before them; for they were now almost at the
end of that enchanted lane which leads to the
City of Married Love—the Enchanted Muddle.
And the tall spires towered so close and glorious,
the mean streets lay in such a tender haze, the
golden gates were so nearly opening, that their
happy eyes were blinded to all else in the world
beside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mrs. Atterton had not been wandering in
the enchanted lane, and she had lived in that city
for such a long time that she had forgotten how it
looked from the outside, so naturally she felt
astonished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth!” was all she could gasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Andy and Elizabeth did look back along
the shining lane, and see an unimportant figure
in the distance which, they vaguely felt, they might
find of some importance again, sometime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We said good-bye for ever—that night I
dined at the Stamfords—it was too late,” explained
Elizabeth incoherently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why?” began Mrs. Atterton, but she
could get no further, she was so bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I had lost her for ever—and now
she’s mine,” said Andy, as much to an astonished
universe as to his future mother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, they did manage in the end to make
it clear, so far as any one could, how the whole
thing had happened; and then Mrs. Atterton was
so simply glad with them that even two young
lovers in the first engrossment of their new joy
could not fail to be touched by her attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother—I don’t believe you care about
anything in the world so long as we three children
are happy,” said Elizabeth, laughing and crying
and clinging to her. And in that moment she
realised for the first time something of what it
means to be a mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must take care of her,” said Mrs. Atterton,
over her girl’s bent head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” was all Andy said, looking straight at
her; but some of the dearest and most sacred
things in life passed in that unspoken conversation
between Andy and Elizabeth’s mother, though
neither of them knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Mr. Atterton’s voice was heard in the
hall, and he, in his turn, went through the same
stages of surprise and anger and relief as his
wife; and after that Norah and Bill did likewise,
until, finally, some one had leisure to feel dreadfully
sorry for the Stamfords. But it was Norah
who went to the heart of that matter with a clear-sighted—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long as Dick’s all right, they’ll be all
right. Don’t you worry yourself about that,
mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they wanted Elizabeth,” said Mrs. Atterton,
wiping away a tear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” remarked Mr. Atterton, “all I can
say under the circumstances is, thank God they
haven’t got her.” Then the memory of Dick’s
perfidy roused his wrath again, and he muttered
fiercely: “That hound—that hound—if he ever
comes near me.... What did he get engaged
to my girl for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norah looked across at him with her odd little
smile: “Look here, father, I believe Dick would
have given anything to run away that night
mother sent him to Elizabeth in the morning-room.
I watched him going through the hall
when he thought he was alone—I couldn’t make
it out, then—but if ever a man was saying to himself,
‘I’m in a dickens of a fix,’ Dick Stamford
did at that moment. Only after asking leave a
year ago, before he’d even met the lovely Phyllis——”
Norah broke off, leaving the rest to their
imaginations, for she was nothing if not suggestive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be so awkward—such near neighbours,”
sighed Mrs. Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, mother,” said Elizabeth, “it will be
delightful. Every time we see Dick and his wife
we shall think how thankful we are, and every
time they see us they will think how thankful <span class='it'>they</span>
are, so the oftener we meet the jollier we shall
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was a point of view so in keeping with
the sentiments of the Atterton family that by the
time the guests had been informed by telephone
and wire that the marriage would not take place,
they all regarded the unpleasant part of the business
as over and done with, and were ready for the
next jolly thing. Probably no interrupted wedding
ever went like that before, but then there are
not many Attertons. And they were so tremendously
glad that Elizabeth had escaped being unhappy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think,” said Mrs. Atterton, raising cold
beef to her lips at luncheon, “that it is all over;
and that we have food in this house to feed a
hundred people!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” said Bill, jumping up with a sort of
war-whoop and flinging down his napkin. “Girls—do
not eat cold beef when a banquet waits without!
Hi! Minion!” to the convulsed Sims, who
adored him and regarded his vilest pun as the
essence of refined art, “Fetch forth the baked
meats which the seneschal has basted for the
morrow’s feast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A seneschal isn’t a cook, you idiot!” laughed
Norah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is some boned turkey, ma’am,” suggested
Sims at Mrs. Atterton’s elbow, “and a
good many of the sweets are made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and let’s see for ourselves,” shouted
Bill, who was rather beyond himself with all the
excitement. “Andy—Elizabeth—Father, come
on! Norah, don’t be grand to-day. Sims, lead
on to the larder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, pulling, pushing, shouting, dancing by Mrs.
Atterton’s side like a lunatic at large, did that insane
Bill manage to get his family out of the dining-room
and into the great still-room, where the
fine dishes that were ready for the luncheon next
day had been already placed. It was only when
the cook hurried in, flushed and indignantly astonished,
that they knew how utterly ridiculous
they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, cook,” said the brazen Bill, the only
one not abashed, “as we can’t have a wedding
feast to-morrow, we’ll have one to-day. We’ll
take the six best sweets and the boned turkey, and
you can have a jollification in the servants’ hall
with the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam!” said the cook, turning upon her
mistress. It was all she could say, but it saved
her from bursting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill—this is really too——” began Mrs. Atterton
when the queer spirit which had inspired
her husband at the dancing class, months ago,
took possession of him again and made him seize
a tall tower made of pink and white cream, step
forward jauntily, and call back over his shoulder
a reckless—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll lead—everybody a dish. Now—Tum-tum-te-tum-tum-tum-tum!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is a fact that they all walked out of the
still-room headed by Mr. Atterton humming the
wedding march in a sort of hoarse, crowing bellow;
and Sims brought up the rear with a jelly in
his hand and tears of laughter rolling down his
purple cheeks, while he tried to look as if nothing
unusual were happening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can never,” said Mrs. Atterton breathlessly,
suddenly remembering her back, “you can
never wonder again why Bill is so idiotic. It’s
hereditary. He can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Andy—make Elizabeth have some of that
pink stuff. She has eaten nothing for ages. But
she won’t ‘want to willow’ now. A parson’s wife
should look solid,” called Bill across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody laughed and sat down, while Andy
cut off the top of the pink tower; and as he
brought the plate to Elizabeth it seemed just the
lovely beginning of all the ways in which he meant
to serve her throughout their lives. Their fingers
touched as she took it from him, and their deep
happiness made them grave for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Atterton said comfortably—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, it will be great fun getting the
furniture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we’ll all go up to London and help to
choose,” concluded Bill. “What fun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So there was another jolly side of it, and Mrs.
Atterton felt almost consoled for the loss of the
Stamfords’ heirlooms by the thought of buying
furniture for Elizabeth’s new home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is to become of Flitterkins?” said
Bill. “The lady with the roving eye—you won’t
want her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might find Mrs. Jebb a post,” said Mr.
Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She doesn’t want a post; she wants a home,”
said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should hate to behave badly to her,” said
Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Norah gave her opinion—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little fancy shop at Bardswell, where she
can be as refined as she likes, and talk about Mr.
Jebb to everybody until she sees him in wings
with a halo round his head, and really believes
she never could have married anybody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could all buy embroidery silks every time
we went into Bardswell, whether we wanted them
or not,” agreed Mrs. Atterton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll stock the shop when we go to buy the
furniture,” said Elizabeth eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And call it ‘The Ladies’ Needlework Club,’ ”
added Norah, with her little smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Elizabeth,” remarked Bill, “I shall
take back that hunting-crop and give you a new
wedding present. What would you like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elizabeth looked first at him and then at her
lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mahogany sideboard with a plate-glass
back exactly like Mrs. Simpson’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” cried Bill. “Go on, you silly! I
mean, really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that they went away from the table, and
there was a buzz of talking and laughter, until
Elizabeth and Andy found themselves alone at
last in the twilight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t think it silly about the sideboard?”
said Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Andy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the last unspoken conversation here recorded
was quite different.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
